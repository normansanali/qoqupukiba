Her single “Save Your Love” peaked at number seven on the R&B/Hip-Hop charts.</p><p>Tracie’s biggest hits, “This House” and “Tender Kisses,” which peaked at No. 3 on the <strong>Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&B charts,</strong> respectively, are still among her most celebrated performances today.</p><h2><span id=Tender_Kisses_Tracie_Spencer8217s_Hit_Song>Tender Kisses, Tracie Spencer’s Hit Song</span></h2><p>Spencer’s net worth is undoubtedly in the millions, thanks to his worldwide fans and memorable recognition.</p><p>Tracie herself put an end to her seemingly unstoppable career when she mysteriously disappeared from the industry.</p><p>Tracie’s fans and admirers have continued her legacy by streaming her songs on platforms like Spotify, YouTube, and Apple Music.</p><p>However, people occasionally inquire about Tracie’s whereabouts, but Spencer appears to have no plans to fulfill her fans’ wishes because she enjoys her current life.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Catherine O’Hara Condemns Plastic Surgery?
