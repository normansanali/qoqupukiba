Lizzie McGuire was a massive hit for the network, and it served as both <a href=#>a show for iconic fashion</a>, and a launching point for stars like Hilary Duff. Lizzie McGuire was one of the most popular Disney Channel shows of all time, and its stars have lived wildly <a href=#>different lives since the show ended</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LaLaine starred as Miranda on the show, and while <a href=#>she didn't appear in the movie</a>, she remains an integral part of the show's history.</p><p>It's been many years since Lizzie McGuire ended, so let's check in and see what LaLaine has been up to!</p><h2 id=lalaine-called-miranda-an-amplified-version-of-herself-on-lizzie-mcguire>LaLaine Called Miranda An Amplified Version Of Herself On Lizzie McGuire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar41784440.jpg><p>For those of us that grew up in the '90s and 2000s, Lizzie McGuire was a major part of our TV routine. This means that talented actress LaLaine was a fixture in our living rooms after we finally made it home from school.</p><p>One of the show's greatest strengths was its ability to resonate with viewers across the globe. It also did a perfect job of nailing the casting process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the young LaLaine, she noticed a lot of herself in the character, but on an entirely different level.</p><p>"Miranda is an amplified version of Lalaine," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress said</a>.</p><p>Lizzie McGuire's impact extended far beyond its initial run on Disney Channel. The show sparked a global phenomenon, inspiring merchandise, books, and even a theatrical movie, The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003). The film's success further solidified the show's influence and allowed fans to experience Lizzie's adventures on the big screen.</p><p>At this stage in her career, LaLaine was rolling. She was on a hit TV show, in a hit film, and was even releasing music. Her solo album, Inside Story, was released in 2003, but didn't become a major hit.</p><p>Following the success of the show, LaLaine's career took an interesting turn.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The Cast Of ‘Chilling Adventures of Sabrina’ Has Been Up To Since The Show Was Canceled</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lalaine-went-on-to-be-featured-in-movies-like-easy-a-with-emma-stone>LaLaine Went On To Be Featured In Movies Like Easy A With Emma Stone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar41694181.jpg><p>LaLaine's talent on screen, as well as her early success, opened the door to appear in additional projects. On the big screen, the actress would make appearances in movies like Her Best Move, Royal Kill, and even Easy A, which was a breakout hit, and a major launching vehicle for Emma Stone.</p><p>Easy A received positive reviews from critics, who praised its clever writing, charismatic performances, and sharp humor. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film boasts an impressive approval rating of 85% based on reviews from reputable critics. The consensus states, "It owes a huge debt to older (and better) teen comedies, but Easy A proves a smart, witty showcase for its irresistibly charming star, Emma Stone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LaLaine wasn't done there, however, as she would also continue acting on the small screen.</p><p>According to her filmography the actress appeared on shows like All That following her time on Lizzie McGuire.</p><p>Now, as you've noticed, these highlighted projects are all from yesteryear, but the actress has been popping up in the news more, opening up about her experiences in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Jujubee Been Up To Since Her First Appearance On RuPaul's Drag Race?</a></span></p><h2 id=in-2019-lalaine-hung-out-with-even-stevens-star-christy-carlson-romano-and-dished-on-her-hollywood-experience>In 2019, LaLaine Hung Out With Even Stevens Star, Christy Carlson Romano, And Dished On Her Hollywood Experience</h2><p>In 2007, LaLaine dealt with some legal issues.</p><p>Per Ned Hardy, Lalaine "was arrested and charged with felony possession of methamphetamine, to which she later pled guilty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After failing to appear at a mandatory court hearing, a $50,000 bench warrant for her arrest was issued but later recalled.

It was a treat for fans, as many had wondered where LaLaine had been.</p><p>That same year, LaLaine took to Instagram to share about her experience as a young star, which included looking as differently as possible.</p><p>"Most of my life growing up I was forced to look as ‘white’ as possible," she wrote in a post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“These days I struggle to find photos where I look as ethnic as possible.
