<time>05 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>DX is one of the most iconic factions in professional wrestling history. While others might have been just as or more dominant in the ring, none reached the heights of popularity that DX achieved during the Attitude Era. They defined attitude and were the type of anti-establishment group the WWE needed to compete with the thriving WCW and its NWO faction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The stable originated with Shawn Michaels and Triple H and later included Chyna and Rick Rude, the latter of whom was only involved for a brief period of time. The iteration of the stable that stands out for most people was the Triple-H-led group that consisted of "Road Dogg" Jesse James, "Bad Ass" Billy Gunn, X-Pac, and Chyna. While it's unlikely we'll see a modern version of DX anytime soon given how risque they were, these 16 superstars would have certainly been great fits in the faction back in the day.</p><h2 id=mojo-rawley><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Mojo Rawley</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mojosportingnews.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mojo Rawley wouldn't be the first choice to be added to DX, but it would make sense. The dude doesn't just get hyped, he stays hyped. His energy can be contagious and it would be great to have seen him in a role similar to Billy Gunn. It doesn't hurt that he almost certainly still laughs out loud when hearing the number 69. That's a prerequisite for being in DX.</p><h2 id=carmella><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Carmella</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/carmellaSI.jpg><p>Chyna was the most memorable woman in DX. She basically served as Triple H's bodyguard early in her tenure with WWE and was later the muscle for every member in DX. She wasn't the only woman in the faction, however. Tori later joined and had a kayfabe relationship with X-Pac. Carmella would have been even better in a similar role. She's also proven to be comfortable in comedic situations during her partnership with R-Truth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roderick-strong><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Roderick Strong</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/roddywwe.jpg><p>Roderick Strong is the second lead in The Undisputed Era and almost by association seems as though he would have been a great fit in DX. He's more than capable in the ring and on the mic and is in such incredible shape that he would easily get over as eye candy with female fans.</p><h2 id=kevin-owens><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Kevin Owens</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kevinowenswrestlinginc.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin Owens has shown the ability to perform just as effectively as a heel and babyface, which is a good sign that he would have been a solid addition to DX. While the faction were introduced as heels, they were largely babyface based on crowd reaction and did a great job of straddling the heel-babyface line for years.</p><h2 id=austin-theory><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Austin Theory</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/austinyoutube.jpg><p>Austin Theory is only 22 years old but one of the hottest prospects in WWE. He has skyrocketed from Evolve to the WrestleMania card in less than one year, albeit as a result of strange circumstances. Nonetheless, the company is high on Theory and believes he has the look and charisma to be a big star on the main roster. His cocky confidence would have played well in DX.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-usos><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>The Usos</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/usosewrestling.jpg><p>The New Age Outlaws were a huge part of DX. The team won six Tag Team Titles throughout its run in WWE and had one of the best entrances in the company. The Usos, while different in terms of athleticism, are similar to the Outlaws in many ways. A modern and revamped DX would be a great spot for The Usos' brash confidence. The team can even bring the heat from a comedy standpoint. Just go back and watch their rap battle with The New Day in 2017.</p><h2 id=liv-morgan><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Liv Morgan</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/livmorganwwe.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liv Morgan, as evidenced by her bathtub vignettes prior to re-debuting as Lana's scorned lover, has the sex appeal necessary to have been a major star during the Attitude Era. But beyond that she's also incredibly zany, goofy, and not afraid to do crazy things to make others laugh. We saw this part of her real-life personality while she was with The Riott Squad. Wacky antics were a major part of the DX shtick and Morgan would have excelled in that regard.</p><h2 id=buddy-murphy><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Buddy Murphy</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/buddywwe.jpg><p>Although he's playing a more serious role now as one of Seth Rollins' disciples, Buddy Murphy would be equally comfortable in a much different faction, ie. DX. He has the look of a top star and is quite simply someone that's easy to picture in a black-and-green DX shirt giving the crotch chop to an outraged Vince McMahon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Pics Buddy Murphy Doesn't Want Us To See Of Alexa Bliss</a></span></p><h2 id=dolph-ziggler><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Dolph Ziggler</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dolphwwe.jpg><p>Dolph Ziggler has been compared to Shawn Michaels for much of his career so it only makes sense that he would have been a solid addition to DX. While he might lack some of the charisma and fan adoration of the Heartbreak Kid, it wasn't hard to win over fans with childish behaviors during the Attitude Era.</p><h2 id=r-truth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>R-Truth</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rtruthwrestlingedge.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This might sound absurd at first, but the fact is R-Truth would shine in any role he's given. He's playing a dim-witted, wacky character right now, but he's been just as believable in more serious roles. Heck, he even formed a tag team with Road Dogg after DX went their separate ways.</p><h2 id=matt-riddle><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Matt Riddle</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mattriddlewe.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Riddle</a>'s laid back bro gimmick would have been a perfect fit in DX, but it's all the subtle - or perhaps not-so-subtle - references to his interest in marijuana that would have made him an ideal candidate for DX. The faction was known to make immature jokes and sexual innuendos in their promos and Riddle would have had the pot jokes covered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mandy-rose><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Mandy Rose</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mandyroseTPWW.jpg><p>Mandy Rose is not only the most beautiful woman in WWE, but one of the most physically fit. She's not quite Chyna, but she definitely could have gotten over as an intimidating threat at ringside during matches. Her willingness to embrace and even flaunt her sexuality is another authentically DX attribute.</p><h2 id=aj-styles><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>AJ Styles</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ajstyleswwe.jpg><p>AJ Styles would have been a great fit in DX, but then again he would likely excel in any role. He's just that talented. Nonetheless, we know he would be a great addition to DX since he has already been in The OC and The Bullet Club, both of which are variations of DX for a new generation of wrestlers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-cole><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Adam Cole</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adamcolewwe.jpg><p>Adam Cole has already proven he can successfully lead a popular, anti-establishment faction for years in NXT with The Undisputed Era. The faction has elements of DX, particularly the cool factor, and Cole's charisma and signature cheer of "Adam Cole, BAY-BAY" is a major contributor in that regard. It doesn't hurt that he looks and wrestles like Shawn Michaels.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Current NXT Rumors Triple H Wants To Keep On The DL</a></span></p><h2 id=roman-reigns><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Roman Reigns</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/reignsSI.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This might be divisive, but Joe Anoa'i would be a perfect fit in DX. The character of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roman Reigns</a>, especially at this point in time given his relationship with fans, wouldn't work in the faction. However, outside of the ring Anoa'i AKA Reigns is quick-witted and well liked by his peers. He's a locker room leader and would have thrived in that role - as he did in The Shield.</p><h2 id=becky-lynch><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Becky Lynch</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/beckyESPN.jpg><p>"The Man" has become the biggest star in the WWE women's division in years - perhaps of all-time - and is the longest-reigning Raw Women's Champion. She has defeated Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler at WrestleMania. But it's because of her charisma and anti-establishment vibe that would make her a great fit in DX.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Photos Vince McMahon Can't Stop Looking At Of Sonya Deville</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhob2WdpLGmvs1mrrCdXay%2Fpr%2FTpZyrq12stbB51qispZxdna63sYybnJ6mXaWys7LEnKtmnp%2BneqXEjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f16-modern-wwe-wrestlers-who-would-have-been-perfect-for-dx.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anthony-hudson-new-job-why-did-he-leave-usmnt-career-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anthony-hudson-new-job-why-did-he-leave-usmnt-career-net-worth.html>Anthony Hudson New Job: Why Did He Leave USMNT?
