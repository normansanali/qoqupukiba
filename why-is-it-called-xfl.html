Despite assumptions that the "X" in XFL stands for extreme or Xtreme, it actually does not stand for anything. The name was chosen because it sounded catchy and did not have any specific meaning.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The original Xtreme Football League name was already taken when the XFL was founded in 1999. Vince McMahon, the founder of the XFL, did joke that the league would be the "Xtra Fun League" compared to the NFL. However, the league's name was ultimately chosen because it was unique, memorable, and had a certain level of intrigue associated with it.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The XFL has undergone several iterations since its original founding, with each new version of the league attempting to improve upon the previous one. The most recent iteration of the XFL was revived for the 2020 season, with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and a group of investors owning the league after purchasing it for $15 million in 2020.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The league consists of eight teams split into two divisions, playing a 10-week season with no bye weeks. Players in the XFL earn $5,000 per week, with only $800 guaranteed, and the league plans to collaborate with the NFL on enhancements to game rules, officiating, and player safety. The XFL will use its 2020 rulebook, which differs from the NFL in various ways, including kickoffs and touchbacks.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The XFL is a professional American football minor league consisting of eight teams located across the United States in mid-sized to major markets. The league is designed to provide an alternative to the NFL for football fans who are looking for a different type of football experience.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the reasons why the XFL has become so popular is because of its unique approach to the game of football. The league's rulebook is designed to encourage fast-paced and high-scoring games, with rules such as the double forward pass and the three-point conversion. These rules have helped to make the XFL a more exciting and unpredictable league than the NFL, which has been criticized in recent years for being too predictable and slow-paced.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another reason why the XFL has become so popular is because of the quality of its players. While the league is considered a minor league, it still attracts top talent from around the country. Many players in the XFL have played in the NFL or have the potential to play in the NFL in the future.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Overall, the XFL is called the XFL because it is a unique and catchy name that has helped to make the league stand out from other football leagues. Despite not having a specific meaning, the name has become synonymous with fast-paced, high-scoring games and a unique football experience. As the XFL continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the league continues to differentiate itself from other football leagues and attract new fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7Jlmah6qsCMnJilpJWZermyyw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-it-called-xfl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-it-called-xfl.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-it-called-xfl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-it-called-xfl.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-it-called-xfl.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-it-called-xfl.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zak-dossi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zak-dossi.html>Zak Dossi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-kaisa-hietala-everything-to-know.html>Who is Kaisa Hietala?
