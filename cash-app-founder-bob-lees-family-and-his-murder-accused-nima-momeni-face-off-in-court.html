According to court filings, Lee met with his suspected killer's sister, Khazar Momeni, hours before his death and police pieced together the crime in part by studying text messages sent between Lee and Khazar Momeni.</p><p>In a text exchange recounted by prosecutors in court files, Khazar Momeni warned the tech titan that he "handled himself with class" after her brother allegedly "came way down hard" on him. According to a witness, In Lee's hotel room, Nima Momeni was questioning him about "whether his sister was doing drugs or anything inappropriate," as per a Fox News report.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Bob Lee visited a suspected drug dealer's apartment with the sister of his alleged killer</h2><p>In a recent report in , &nbsp;Bob Lee visited a suspected drug dealer's apartment with the sister of his alleged killer just hours before his violent death.

"It doesn't seem like it matters to her because she's flirting with me." Ipakchi also said Lee “liked to party.” He liked to, unfortunately, do a lot of drugs,” Ipakchi said. “But he was the sweetest guy ever. He always had this light around him,” the publication reported.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5GotW6tz6lkn6elo7GmvoybpptlnJqytHnFmqSipKlirq%2BwjKGgrGWdqr%2BlsdFmmJybpaiypXnNoqSaZZ2kuqa6yGadmpuVYrynsoyipWabn6q%2FtQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcash-app-founder-bob-lees-family-and-his-murder-accused-nima-momeni-face-off-in-court.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcash-app-founder-bob-lees-family-and-his-murder-accused-nima-momeni-face-off-in-court.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcash-app-founder-bob-lees-family-and-his-murder-accused-nima-momeni-face-off-in-court.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcash-app-founder-bob-lees-family-and-his-murder-accused-nima-momeni-face-off-in-court.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcash-app-founder-bob-lees-family-and-his-murder-accused-nima-momeni-face-off-in-court.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcash-app-founder-bob-lees-family-and-his-murder-accused-nima-momeni-face-off-in-court.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-and-1070-founders-edition-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-and-1070-founders-edition-review.html>Power, Temperature, &amp;amp; Noise - The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 &amp;amp; GTX 1070 Founders Editions Review: Kicki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nba-legends-basketball-news-new-step-father-of-shaquille-oneals-millionaire-son-myles-houston-pastor-keion-henderson-gets-insane-love-for-stint-with-michael-jordans-billion-dollar-company-and-dj-khale.html>New Step-Father of Shaquille ONeals Millionaire Son, Houston Pastor GetsInsane Love for</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nba-legends-basketball-news-new-step-father-of-shaquille-oneals-millionaire-son-myles-houston-pastor-keion-henderson-gets-insane-love-for-stint-with-michael-jordans-billion-dollar-company-and-dj-khale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
