He should have made a lot of money over the course of his career. However, <strong>his net worth is believed to be between</strong> <strong>$1 million – $5 million as of November 2023.</strong></p><h2>Professional Life, Career & Living Style</h2><p>John Scarce began playing ‘Call of Duty and quickly rose to prominence as a professional trickshot artist. On January 25, 2012, he launched his YouTube channel ‘GoScarce’ and began uploading gaming videos such as ‘MW2 Commentary: 2 Sick Clips! (AMAZING)’ and ‘Minecraft LIVE: Episode 1 – Vepu can Minecraft Trickshot.’ His contributions were praised, and he quickly found himself a member of the ‘Call of Duty squad ‘Strictly Business.’ He also joined other game clans such as ‘AE7’ and ‘Obey.’</p><p>His rising fame compelled him to become more inventive, and he began producing news videos. The war between notorious YouTuber Keemstar and the ‘Call of Duty ‘FaZe’ clan was one of the first news reports to go viral. As Keemstar’s channel was also drama-centric, this will spark a rivalry between the two YouTubers. Finally, in 2015, he was accepted into the ‘FaZe’ clan. This was just the beginning, as he went on to become the head of the largest COD clan, ‘Red,’ alongside his ‘FaZe’ teammates.</p><p>His contentious news reports, on the other hand, landed him in hot water with not just his clan members but also with Keemstar.
