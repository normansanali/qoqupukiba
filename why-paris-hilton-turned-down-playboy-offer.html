Despite her refusal, the heiress revealed she was made the cover of the controversial magazine. And Hilton is now speaking out about her experience.</p><h2 id=how-other-playboy-models-feel-about-their-cover>How Other Playboy Models Feel About Their Cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hugh-hefner-looking-upset.jpg><p><a href=#>Hilton's story is not unique.</a> Former Girls Next Door stars Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt have shared their negative experiences at the Playboy Mansion, where they were asked to have sex with Hefner in front of other women who hated them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Such revelations have raised questions about how women were treated at the Playboy Mansion and the ethical implications of using women's bodies for commercial purposes.</p><p>Despite the negative experiences of some women, others have enjoyed appearing in Playboy over the years, such as Dolly Parton and Pamela Anderson.</p><p>Dolly Parton recreated her infamous Playboy cover at the age of 75. Pamela Anderson, who has appeared on the cover of Playboy more than any other person, revealed that Hugh Hefner was the one person throughout her entire career whom she felt treated her with respect throughout her entire career.</p><p>However, the legacy of Playboy magazine is complicated. Heather Rae El Moussa has complicated feelings about her work with the magazine. While she acknowledges that it "catapulted" her career, she is unsure how to tell her children about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine's legacy and cultural place are being reexamined as society evolves.

While the magazine claimed to empower women by featuring articles on women's issues and interviews with prominent female figures, the images of nude or scantily clad women garnered the most attention.</p><p>Critics argue that Playboy's representation of women was a regressive and narrow view of femininity that reduced women to objects of male desire.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Prior To Stepping Foot In The Playboy Mansion, Rob Lowe Revealed He Already Felt 'Less Than'</a></span></p><p>Moreover, the magazine has been criticized for lacking diversity regarding the models featured and the content it produced. Playboy's idealized image of beauty was often limited to a particular body type, which did not represent the diverse range of women's bodies.</p><p>This narrow view of beauty reinforced unrealistic and unhealthy body standards for women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The magazine stopped featuring nude models in 2016, signaling a shift towards a more inclusive and modern approach to sexuality.
