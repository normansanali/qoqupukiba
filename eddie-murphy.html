His parents split when he was three and his father was murdered when he was eight.</p><p id=eQpJcytJHq data-wc=63>For a year, Murphy and his brother Charlie lived in the foster care system when their mother was ill, which influenced Murphy's comedy in his later years. They eventually returned home and were raised by his mother and stepfather. He first started performing at local events in 1976, secretly skipping school, but was forced into summer school once his mother discovered his deceit.</p><h2>Eddie Murphy's Career and Rise to Fame</h2><p id=eSKuMbf0mo data-wc=74>His big break came in 1980, when he became part of the cast of , remaining till 1984 and being credited for helping revitalize the sketch comedy show. He made his movie debut in 1982 with 48 Hrs and became a superstar of the 1980s with roles in (1983), the franchise (first beginning in 1984), and (1988), attracting box office success and critical acclaim.</p><p id=e6iIgci4UH data-wc=76>He made his directorial debut with the 1989 film , which was panned then but now considered a cult classic, and his biggest successes of the '90s were 1996's for originating the role of Mushu in Disney's animated Mulan (1998), and the same year. In the '00s, he pivoted to family-friendly fare, with his biggest commercial blockbusters coming through the Shrek franchise (starting in 2001) and The Haunted Mansion (2003).</p><p id=eU380Lx7eFa data-wc=91>He received significant attention for his dramatic turn in 2006's theatrical adaptation of Dreamgirls and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. While the rest of the 2000s-2010s remained slow, he achieved a career resurgence thanks to 2019's Dolemite Is My Name, garnering him more critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nod, and the sequel to Coming to America, Coming 2 America, in 2021. He followed that up with a return to SNL in December 2019, his first time hosting since 1984, which was met with rave reviews.</p><p id=eZoWRfQoR5 data-wc=47>As a singer, Murphy released three albums: (1985), (1989), and (1993), achieving a smash hit with the single 'Party All the Time' from his debut record. He also covered several hits as his character Donkey for the Shrek franchise.</p><h2>Eddie Murphy's Personal Life</h2><p id=eMY4dbpEuv data-wc=65>Murphy's private life has been the subject of much tabloid fodder due to his relationships and family. He welcomed his first child in 1989 with girlfriend Paulette McNeely and another in 1990 with then-girlfriend Tamara Hood. In 1993, he tied the knot with Nicole Mitchell, with whom he had five more children. In 2005, they announced their separation, and they were divorced the following year.</p><p id=exGiVsK_bX data-wc=82>He had a short-lived relationship with Spice Girl Melanie Brown aka Mel B, during which she became pregnant.

While he almost tied the knot with film producer Tracey Edmonds in 2008, they broke up soon after. Since 2012, he has been in a relationship with Australian model Paige Butcher, with whom he has two more children, and they announced their engagement in 2018.</p><p id=e8DOPqXBth data-wc=8><a class=hm-link href=#>here</a></p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xbWZksqWwyJ5kpq2ipbW6ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feddie-murphy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feddie-murphy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feddie-murphy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feddie-murphy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feddie-murphy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feddie-murphy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-song-about-friend-emma-stone-graham-norton-show-interview.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-song-about-friend-emma-stone-graham-norton-show-interview.html>Emma Stone Evaded An Awkward Question About Taylor Swift On The Graham Norton Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./olivia-munn-lips-bigger-plastic-surgery-fans-react-tweets.html>Did Olivia Munn Get Her Lips Done?
