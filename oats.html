Why didn’t I think of this combo before?” This&nbsp;red and green ingredient pairing&nbsp;of pistachios and strawberries is like Christmas in&nbsp;July, er… June. This strawberry crumble recipe works just as well with walnuts or pecans, but&nbsp;it’s just so pretty with pistachios.

I was craving a cookie, but I didn’t have the exact ingredients for my oatmeal cookie recipe on hand. I messed around with it, swapping in what I did have, and I ended up with a sweet and nutty “dough” made from oats and almond butter. It was never going to bake into perfect oatmeal cookies, but it tasted so good that I immediately thought, “Energy bites!” A few tests later, and these oatmeal energy balls have become my favorite healthy snack. They’re rich, nutty, and chewy, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>For a while, I went through a frittata&nbsp;phase, then there was the chia bowl phase, followed by a bit of a smoothie kick…&nbsp;which brings us to my current morning trend: cookies for breakfast! But before you think I’ve completely given up on myself, hear me out – I make these cookies with lots of good things – carrots, oats, flax, walnuts, pepitas, cranberries, and QUINOA. Yes, carrots and quinoa – it almost sounds like a salad, but I promise you these “healthier” cookies are so delicious and energizing in the morning. They’re also vegan, gluten-free, and sweetened with maple syrup…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I have to say that my favorite part about Christmas is wrapping the gifts. When I was in college in Chicago, I had a part time job&nbsp;wrapping gifts at the infamous Marshall Fields on State Street. Their gift wrap room was full of rolls of beautiful wrap, ribbon, and bows&nbsp;–&nbsp;it was a small haven from the holiday chaos that was happening everywhere else outside in&nbsp;the city. So recently, when I was given the opportunity to go through The Container Store’s “Gift Wrap Wonderland,” I was positively giddy. Of course they have gift wrap galore, but they also adorable jars, tags,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Saturday, friends! Fall is in the air, and although&nbsp;it’s not exactly crisp outside here, I’ve made crisp inside to make up for it. Apple crisp is hands down my favorite fall dessert. I love apple pie too, but I love it more when other people make it for me.&nbsp;This vegan apple crisp recipe is simple and straightforward&nbsp;– you can&nbsp;mix everything&nbsp;together and get these little guys&nbsp;into the oven in no time. (You can even mix the crumble part ahead of time). To make these vegan, I used coconut oil instead of butter and scooped vegan ice cream on top. These…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In my opinion, these vegan chocolate oatmeal cookies are the perfect cookies. If you’re not vegan, don’t let the “vegan” part of this title distract you – there’s nothing vegan tasting about them. These are cookies that happen to be vegan because I like to save my eggs for breakfast and, well, I like to eat more raw cookie dough than the average person. These cookies are rich, chewy, and sweet, but not too sweet. They have the most delicious pop of flavor from the dried&nbsp;tart cherries, which are the star here. They’re soft, plump, and chewy, and they’ve made…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let me start out by saying: I’m not a cereal person. I’ve told this story before – my sister and I used to BEG my mom for all of the artificially colored sugary cereals with fun cartoon characters… sometimes she’d give in but always with the disclaimer “only if you actually eat it this time.”&nbsp;We would excitedly make this promise&nbsp;only to go home, have one bowl and never touch it again. This granola, however – I’ll happily eat cereal-style.&nbsp;But with almond milk instead of regular milk because we all know that Almond Breeze is my go-to milk.

These granola bars were inspired by their recipe for Chocolate-Peanut Butter Granola Bars, which&nbsp;reminded me of the ones my mom used to pack into my school lunch everyday. I might not have that Barbie and the Rockers lunchbox anymore, but I thought it would be fun to recreate this favorite afternoon treat in a healthier way. My version is packed with goji berries, chia seeds, pistachios, pepitas, (and of course, chocolate)… These are so quick & easy to make.&nbsp;Click over to the BHG Dish…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I made a half batch of these cookies, which was clearly a mistake. I ate the last one for breakfast this morning&nbsp;and I could really go for another one right about now. Chewy, oaty, nutty… slightly sweet and warmly spiced… it’s the kind of cookie&nbsp;that’s just healthy enough to get by as breakfast but would be even more&nbsp;perfect as a 2pm snack. If only… This recipe is just slightly adapted&nbsp;from Amy Chaplin’s book At Home in the Whole Food Kitchen, which is hands down one of&nbsp;the most beautiful cookbooks I’ve ever held.

Because this is a dessert for 2. Get it? Jack is sitting next to me right now shaking his head, but honestly, I love desserts that are easy to make in small portions. See, if I made a pear crisp recipe large enough to serve 4, it would still serve just the two of us. Just one more bite after one more bite, and it would all be over. We have no control, especially around sweet, cinnamon-spiced fall desserts like this one.

Packed with oats and nuts and naturally sweetened with maple syrup, it’s a great way to get fiber and healthy fats into your first meal of the day. Even better, it clumps well! I add a tablespoon of almond butter to bind the components together, so you get plenty of delicious nutty clusters.
