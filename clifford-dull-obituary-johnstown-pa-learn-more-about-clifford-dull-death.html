At the time of his birth on March 23, 1945, Pete Dull was born in Tiffin, Ohio. His parents were Harold and Hilda (Miller) Dull. Hilda and Harold were the names of his mother and father. His diploma from Tiffin Columbian High School was presented to him in the year 1964. In the end, he received his diploma there.</p><p>It was reported that a number of Big Twelve institutions were interested in recruiting him to play football; however, he declined their offers in order to preserve the financial stability of his family and to continue living in Tiffin. We recently honored him by inducting him into the Tiffin Columbian Athletic Hall of Fame. This honor was bestowed upon him in recognition of his remarkable athletic skills. This award was presented to him as a blessing. He worked as a tool and die welder at Dull’s Body Shop in Tiffin for a number of years prior to spending the remaining 26 years of his job at Jeep.</p><p>He was employed there for a total of 26 years. For a substantial amount of time, he was present at that location. It was on March 2, 1968 that the wedding took place, and Betty Brough was the bride. Pete has always been an athlete and has always had a strong desire to participate in sports. He has been an athlete throughout his entire childhood. For him, one of the things that brought him a great deal of pleasure was taking part in football and basketball leagues alongside his grandson and son, Troy.</p><p>Although they were able to outplay him despite the fact that he constantly placed the ball on a firm lie, he also enjoyed playing golf with his granddaughters. This was despite the fact that they were able to outplay him. The range of subjects that he was truly interested in was quite extensive. You could find him tearing up the dance floor or cuddling up to “Unchained Melody” with his beloved Betty. Both of these activities are possible. In addition to that, he took pleasure in playing chess with his grandson, seeing his granddaughters compete in high school and college golf, and watching his granddaughters play chess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJucnrOnu9GdZJ2tnKF6sK7Irayaqqlit7C0zayrqK%2BeYr2iecuemKumXaK8s7GMmpmoraRisK21xZ%2Bmq5xdmcKtuIydnJqsmGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclifford-dull-obituary-johnstown-pa-learn-more-about-clifford-dull-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fclifford-dull-obituary-johnstown-pa-learn-more-about-clifford-dull-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fclifford-dull-obituary-johnstown-pa-learn-more-about-clifford-dull-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fclifford-dull-obituary-johnstown-pa-learn-more-about-clifford-dull-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclifford-dull-obituary-johnstown-pa-learn-more-about-clifford-dull-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclifford-dull-obituary-johnstown-pa-learn-more-about-clifford-dull-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./curtis-granderson-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./curtis-granderson-net-worth-2024.html>Curtis Granderson Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chesnee-high-school-car-accident-video-gone-viral.html>Chesnee High School Car Accident Video Gone Viral Three Died In Crash</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chesnee-high-school-car-accident-video-gone-viral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
