Viewers were introduced to learn more about him. Here we cover details about their family, girlfriend, height, and more.</p><p>So, keep scrolling down this article to find all the answers.</p><h3><strong>Spencer Storbeck On Charity Lawson’s Bachelorette Season</strong></h3><p>Spencer Storbeck is one of the contestants of The Bachelorette 2023. Much to the fan’s amazement, he was the first to get Charity’s first impression rose, though, Spencer had struggled to make conversation upon coming face to face with the Bachelorette. He said: “My hobby thing, I’ve been doing a lot of martial arts.”</p><p>Spencer attempted to teach Charity how to kick someone in the genitalia when she asked him to demonstrate some maneuvers. Then he assures her firmly that she is secure with him at all times. Although the intention is good, Charity is obviously feeling insecure.</p><p>Later, when asked if he has a son, Spencer answered, “Is it weird that I fear so much to tell you that?” It didn’t take Charity long to fall in love with him due to his wonderful personality, and she gave him the first rose.</p><p>Spencer told him: “That’s huge and I know that’s a very important part of your life, so I need to know that and I want to know more.”</p><p>Viewers noticed his awkwardness and Charity was praised for “gracefully handling”.</p><p>Spencer approaches Charity later in the show to reveal that he has a son. He is relieved to hear her state that she would be eager to see his son if they were to connect because he is anxious about how she will respond. But when the rest of Bachelor Nation discovered that Spencer had fathered a child with someone, they were astounded.</p><p>Not all of Spencer’s critique is accurate. Nobody is aware of his past or how he reacts differently when he is competing for a gorgeous woman’s heart with cameras all around him. In fact,&nbsp;one Twitter user wrote, “I think Spencer is on the spectrum, and if so I’m proud of him because it can’t easy to go on this type of show.”</p><p>Adults who exhibit symptoms of autism include “getting very anxious about social situations, finding it hard to say how you feel, not understanding social “rules,” getting too close to others, and more,” the NHS states. Nobody should be allowed to diagnose any of The Bachelorette’s suitors, but if Spencer had autism, that may help to explain some of his actions. And it would be admirable if he had decided to risk it all and go on the show.</p><p>According to his bio, “This single dad’s got humor and heart. As a father to a young son, Spencer brings a lot of life experience to the table, including having the courage to change careers and pursue his master’s degree. When he’s not talking to medical professionals in his sales job, Spencer enjoys riding his bike along the ocean. His ideal date would be going on a hike through the orange groves outside of his hometown Moorpark.
