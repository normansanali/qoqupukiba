At the time of the interview, she had yet to announce her pregnancy with her husband, Parks and Rec actor Chris Pratt, and there was certainly no evidence on her diminutive frame. As she curled up on a lushly upholstered couch at the Waldorf Astoria while promoting<i> </i>the Sacha Baron Cohen fascist romp <i>The Dictator</i>, Faris talked about her role as a crunchy Brooklyn cause-haver, her dreams for a remote theater refuge in the Pacific Northwest, and playing idiots.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-3-0-0@published data-word-count=21><b>I saw The Dictator last night.

But yeah, I loved sort of playing a character that’s not vain, and clearly not too concerned with the aesthetic end. And I think part of the comedy is that his character has never met or known a girl like that. For me, it was awesome. It was great.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-11-0-0@published data-word-count=89><b>Did he write it with you in mind?</b><br>I don’t think so, no.

I don’t think anybody really wants to know their limits. I think I’d like to think I play all kinds of roles. I don’t know if I can or not, but I like to explore that idea. But I do feel really lucky because I feel like compared to a lot of actors, I have been able to play — I mean, it’s all sort of mostly in the comedy world — but a lot of different types of people; some insane people, some really awful people, mostly all really dumb people. So yeah, I feel pretty fortunate in that. And I think that though, the big thing with that in Hollywood with sort of breaking that idea is time. It just takes time to build up a repertoire with roles.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-16-0-0@published data-word-count=51><b>Is there anything that you’d <b>especially</b> like to do?</b><br>Well, there’s characters on my mind that I want to play, that I want to create and develop.

It’s already written. It’s called <i>The Skeleton Twins</i>. We’re just hoping that financing will come along soon, but it’s a great project. We’re both excited about going down that path. I think all actors, maybe everybody in general has a desire maybe to surprise people. So I think that idea is exciting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-19-0-0@published data-word-count=107><b>Your movie from last year, <i>What’s Your Number? </i>was set up in the media as something of a litmus test for a woman-led comedy.

But I guess you just sort of move forward. I love that movie, but I think it’s like my 32nd movie maybe, so it’s kind of like at some point you just have to distance yourself a little bit from the economic sort of part of this industry.

I mean, I think it’s still scary for Hollywood to sort of commit money to a messy woman. And to a lesser extent, but to some degree, a messy guy as well. But yeah, I do think it’s shifted the conversation because it used to be the conversation when I was pitching movies was always like, “Well, what’s it rated?” And if we said R it was like, “Well, no, it’s got to be PG-13.” Or, either that or the conversation was like, “How do we make this girl likable?” So then you’re forced with the burden of like, winning. You know, the whole cliché is like you want the women in the audience to want you to be their best friend, and the men in the audience to fall in love with you. That’s a whole hell of a lot to be saddled with, and it’s very limiting. So, I’d like to think that that conversation’s shifting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-21-0-0@published data-word-count=12><b>Are you seeing any evidence?</b><br>No, I’m not seeing any evidence.

I mean, we’re both in our thirties now, and I think that our priorities are kind of shifting. I think it would be great to start a family. It’d be great to have maybe a place up in Washington State that we could sort of retreat to. We have a fantasy of starting a weird little theater company on an island in Washington State.

I think we probably need to update the script and work on that a little bit, but with any project, you know it goes through waves of momentum. And I realize now with some distance — because <i>House Bunny</i> was the first movie that I developed, and it happened so fast, I sort of thought that’s how everything kind of worked. So it’s been an interesting lesson to realize, oh, projects, like, stay in development for years and then maybe something happens.

Sometimes I do long for the days when I auditioned and if by some miracle I got the role, like three weeks later you’re shooting. You’ve got a job.

And also it’s great because my husband is friends with all these people. Now there’s just a different feeling when you talk to other actresses, there’s this feeling of, like, let’s do something together, instead of when I first moved to L.A. where it was like, oh, we’re up for the same role. There is a feeling of camaraderie, and the feeling is, like, isn’t this sort of impossible, isn’t this sort of hard? Well, let’s doing something together, wouldn’t it be cool, will you come do a little thing in my movie? It’s an empowering feeling, which is great.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-56479bdf17e462ed4f7bb18ad28dff2a-34-0-0@published data-word-count=106><b>Who are the actresses that are in that world?</b><br>Well, like Zooey Deschanel, and Rashida [Jones], and Amy Poehler, and Abby Elliott, and Kristen Wiig — I mean, she’s on a different level. I don’t know, but she’s like scraping around. The cool thing, though, she’s such a leader and supporter of that kind of collaboration. So, that’s really amazing. It’s just nice when you see these actresses and you’re friends with them and they’re like, I like that person, love to work with them, and I think we just all have each other’s backs.

It’s kind of interesting. But when I was first starting out, it was, like, all the <i>American Pie</i> girls; I was always losing jobs to all of them, I remember.

I love that it’s very British in that all of the dialogue is very quick, and witty, and fun to say, and it’s all very dialogue-based humor. There’s nobody slipping and falling on a fucking bra or whatever. So that’s a great sort of change of pace. It’s very actor-y. It’s been a while since I’ve done a movie with like three other really professional, amazing actors. It’s really rewarding to sit around and laugh and play with these people who are all&nbsp; so good at what they do.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Anna Faris on The Dictator and Playing Idiots</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloa2dganyius2aZJ%2BZop7AbsDHnmSdoZOprrW70Wagp6yVp8OqsdZnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanna-faris-the-dictator-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanna-faris-the-dictator-interview-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanna-faris-the-dictator-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanna-faris-the-dictator-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanna-faris-the-dictator-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanna-faris-the-dictator-interview-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chris-farleys-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chris-farleys-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html>Chris Farleys net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zion-williamson-has-a-weight-clause-in-his-new-193m-deal-that-could-cost-him-millions.html>Zion Williamson 'has a WEIGHT clause in his new $193m deal that could cost him MILLIONS'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zion-williamson-has-a-weight-clause-in-his-new-193m-deal-that-could-cost-him-millions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
