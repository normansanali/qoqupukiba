Before their collective crash and burn, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Blake Lively and Penn Badgley</a> as well as Ed Westwick and Jessica Szohr were coupled up in real life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, I mean, why wouldn't 2008's coolest 20-somethings get together? It's convenient; it's good publicity; it gives you a reason to break out your largest alligator clutch and coolest <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>graphic tee</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, they were sweet. Stan told People he was "a really lucky guy" in regard to his relationship with Meester. When asked how he dealt with his girlfriend's kissing scenes on the show, he said, "It's work and everyone shares the same mentality when it comes to that. But we all laugh about it," adding, "The good part is I get to go home with her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to US Magazine, Stan reportedly bought Meester a (custom) painting for Valentine's Day in 2009. "He told the artist about me, my favorite colors and poetry and she painted a large very special abstract work I have hanging in my dining room," Meester said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-they-peaked></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When They Peaked</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though somewhat private when it came to discussing their relationship, Meester and Stan weren't exactly camera shy. In the spring of 2009, the couple went to a basketball game with fellow Gossip Girl co-star Chace Crawford — and, like, made out at a basketball game in front of fellow Gossip Girl co-star Chace Crawford. I guess Chace didn't seem to mind?</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In spring 2010, about a year following their iconic courtside PDA, Meester and Stan were first reported to have broken up. At the time, OK! reported that Meester had called things off because she "doesn't know how to be in a relationship and doesn't really like them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As bizarre as that reasoning might sound, Meester said as much herself toward the end of 2010, telling Seventeen that she'd "never really liked anybody before," and that in relationships "it was always a relief when we broke up." In fact, she told British Glamour "I've hated every boyfriend I've had," while she and Stan were still together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In that same Seventeen interview, she reportedly admitted that her and Stan's breakup was the only experience "where it was really hard and I was really sad when it ended." Still, she found the positive in the situation, explaining that the split "taught me a lot about myself and love and life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, Meester released her debut album Heartstrings. Meester told fans that the title track, which includes verses like "You took me for granted all the time" and "Had to save my own self from all your evil games," was written about "some stupid breakup that I had when I was 25 or earlier."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At the time it was like,' Screw you, I don't care about you anymore, and it's not going to happen!'" she continued. "Joker."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given that Meester and Stan broke up when she was about 24, there's been speculation that the Marvel star is the "joker" in question. Meester has neither confirmed nor denied this theory.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-they-are-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where They Are Now</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meester wed fellow teen drama star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Adam Brody</a> in 2014. She and the O.C. alum welcomed daughter Arlo in 2015 and a son in late 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress was most recently seen in the ABC sitcom Single Parents, which was canceled shortly after its second season finale aired in May 2020. In 2022, she appeared in a recurring role as Meredith in How I Met Your Father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the Daily Mail, Stan reportedly began dating Spanish actress Alejandra Onieva in 2020. However, he was recently spotted with Annabelle Wallis celebrating his 40th birthday in Greece, sparking rumors of romance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stan co-starred in the Disney+ Marvel series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in 2021.
