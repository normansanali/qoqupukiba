For some people, the skin in this area is more tightly connected to the greater trochanter of the femur, causing the appearance of indentations.<h2>What are Mermaid thighs?</h2>The mermaid thigh movement is a direct response to the thigh gap trend that's taken over Instagram in recent years.

Straight and slender legs are considered especially attractive, say researchers because they combine fragility and strength.<h2>Why are legs so hot?</h2>Venous reflux occurs when the veins in the leg aren't properly circulating blood to the heart. It's also referred to as venous insufficiency. If a leg vein fails, the blood can back up, pool, and leak into the leg tissue.
