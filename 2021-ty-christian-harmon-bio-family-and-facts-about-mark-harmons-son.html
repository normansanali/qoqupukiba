<time>01 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>One of the most popular ‘Marks’ on Google Search is Mark Harmon. Surely, this tells of the man’s iconic personality. One source described him as ‘TV’s most enthralling star’. After a most active acting career that spanned over three decades, coming to an end in 2010, Mark happily has another worthy successor in his son, Ty Christian Harmon.</p><p>But, maybe, Ty is not exactly a successor to Mark all because he has chosen a career path that is slightly different from Mark’s depending on how you see it: Ty is more of a screenwriter than an actor like his great dad. Here, we pay attention to the life, career and more of Ty Christian Harmon to enable you know all there is about him.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Ty Christian Harmon Biography">Ty Christian Harmon Biography</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Family Life">Family Life</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="What Is His Net Worth?">What Is His Net Worth?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="His Height, Weight, And Other Body Measurements">His Height, Weight, And Other Body Measurements</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ty-christian-harmon-biography></span><strong>Ty Christian Harmon Biography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ty Christian Harmon was born exactly six months to Christmas Day of 1992, that is, June 25th. The place was Burbank in Los Angeles. He was born to a great actor Mark Harmon as you already know. His mother Pam Dawber was an actress also, who was seen on screen projects until 2016.</p><p>We have not been able to get any detail on where or when Ty went to elementary school. As for his high school education however, we have records that show he went to Notre Dame High School located at Sherman Oaks, California.</p><p>Ty holds American nationality. As regards his ethnicity, he is a white Caucasian. His sun sign is listed as ‘Cancer’. According to Astrology Zodiac Signs, Cancers are ‘tenacious, highly imaginative, loyal, emotional, sympathetic, persuasive’. But their weaknesses are that they are ‘moody, pessimistic, suspicious, manipulative, insecure’. They are said to like art, home-based hobbies, relaxing near or in water, helping loved ones and a good meal with friends. They also said to hate strangers, any criticism of Mom, and revealing of personal life.</p><p>Let’s see how much of these claimed Zodiac attributes are true about Ty Christian Harmon as we consider more facts about him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-life></span><strong>Family Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One thing that is quite remarkable about Ty Christian Harmon is that show business really runs in their family. We have already mentioned that both of his parents enjoyed very active and long-running acting careers. But then, even his grandparents were not left out. For instance, Thomas Dudley Harmon (1919 – 1990), who was a famous football player, actor, sports broadcaster and military pilot, is Ty’s paternal grandfather. Elyse Knox (1917 – 2012), who was a famous model, fashion designer, and actress, is his paternal grandmother.</p><p>Even Ty Christian Harmon’s aunts and uncles were also part of the family profession. A couple of them did not only choose careers in the show business but also achieved remarkable fame. For instance, Sharon Kristin Nelson (1945 – 2018) was a famous painter, author, and actress. Kristin who also once married actor Ricky Nelson for 19 years, is Ty’s aunt. So also was Kelly Harmon who was a regular face on the 1983 NBC comedy-drama series where she filled the role of Sunny Hayward. Kelly was also famous for appearing on TV commercials for Tic Tac Mints.</p><p>Ty Christian Harmon has an older brother named Sean who is a great film director and actor. There are many other members of Ty’s bloodline who have made big names in the show business/entertainment industry but are too numerous to be mentioned here.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-his-net-worth></span><strong>What Is His Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ty Christian Harmon has been widely described as a prolific screenwriter. For instance, he co-wrote the 2012 film Catholic Schoolgirl Chainsaw Showdown with his elder brother Sean. That film which bears the imprint of Ty’s background in Catholic schools was said to be his first attempt at screenwriting. He has since upped his ante in the art which is what has enabled him to earn that description ‘prolific’.</p><p>Having written numerous screenplays in his career, it is expected that Ty Christian must have amassed a fortune. And yes, he is reported to be worth an estimated sum of $300,000. His dad Mark is also reliably reported to be worth as much as $90 million while his mother is also reported to be worth $10 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-height-weight-and-other-body-measurements></span><strong>His Height, Weight, And Other Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ty Christian Harmon has a slim tall figure. His height is reported to be 5 feet, 8 inches while his weight is 61kg. He has a pair of blue eyes and light brown hair. He is generally described as having a reserved personality that conforms to the attributes of his sun sign.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uwNhmmqGqmajBqq3NZp%2Baqp2ku26uyKhkn5mdnrm6ecCnm2aekZjBtHnAm6aurF2irrO3jKGYq6Wfo8Buv86nZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2021-ty-christian-harmon-bio-family-and-facts-about-mark-harmons-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2021-ty-christian-harmon-bio-family-and-facts-about-mark-harmons-son.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2021-ty-christian-harmon-bio-family-and-facts-about-mark-harmons-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2021-ty-christian-harmon-bio-family-and-facts-about-mark-harmons-son.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2021-ty-christian-harmon-bio-family-and-facts-about-mark-harmons-son.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2021-ty-christian-harmon-bio-family-and-facts-about-mark-harmons-son.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-ushers-girlfriend-everything-there-is-to-know-about-jenn-goicoechea.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-ushers-girlfriend-everything-there-is-to-know-about-jenn-goicoechea.html>Who is Usher's new wife?
