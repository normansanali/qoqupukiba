Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, with lyrics drawn from T. S. Eliot poems, the plot is famously thin: The musical follows a tribe of cats (the Jellicles) who meet up for an annual event (the Jellicle Ball), at which one is chosen to ascend to the “Heaviside Layer” (heaven, basically) and be reborn. But something about the combination of music, dancing, set, and costumes elevated it into an experience that, for many at least, was transcendent. It continued to draw audiences over 38 years, dozens of productions around the world, and now, <a href=#>one star-studded film adaptation</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bunge40029396762hddq0s@published data-word-count=168>But for the performers involved, the first few years of the production — before it became a “Broadway product” — carried an energy that was unrepeatable. When it debuted, it felt edgy and immersive, with a punkish twist. In interviews with 11 members of the original cast, as well as a handful of key crew and creative team members, they shared vivid memories of those early days, from the parade of celebrities who came backstage (including Andy Warhol) to some of the unique challenges the show presented (the performers sweat so much, the microphone transmitters had to be sheathed in condoms). They also spoke about the devastating impact of AIDS on the cast, and the odd dissonance of being in an enormously successful show, yet practically anonymous outside the theater. “We were literally the talk of the town,” said Kenneth Ard, who played <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>Plato, Macavity, and Rumpus Cat</span>. “Of course, after a couple years it became this joke. But it was the most spectacular thing of its time.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck4bunwtp002p3967kbvjdktp@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Auditions: ‘My Body Was Perfect, Everything Was Perfect’</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bunt9z002j3967h89wum8q@published data-word-count=65>Not long after the London show opened, the New York Times declared that, in Britain, tickets were “surpassed in demand only by invitations to the royal wedding” of Prince Charles and Lady Diana that summer. Within a few months, the London-based creative team — choreographer Gillian Lynne, director Trevor Nunn, and Webber — were traveling to New York to begin auditions for the Broadway show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buokqg00313967xl8c1dr9@published data-word-count=55>Kenneth Ard (Plato, Macavity, and Rumpus Cat): Everyone was talking about this new musical, Cats. My friend had just convinced me to come to NY. I had this slinky, lithe body and felt very feline. I was 21, my body was perfect, everything was perfect for what was happening in NY in the early ’80s.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwn00373967jui8d0by@published data-word-count=68>Herman Sebek (Pouncival): I was in the West Side Story tour of Italy and Paris, and when it wrapped, a few cast members said they were going to go to London to see a new show. I thought it was Katz, like the deli. The minute I landed back in the States I opened up Backstage’s audition papers and there it was: Cats USA, the first open call.</p><span class="quote has-quote-marks">Trevor Nunn directed me to sing ‘Memory’ three times.

Some people had agents who arranged auditions, but the rest of us went to the open call. It was difficult because Gillian Lynne had made the dancing like cat movements. I saw excellent dancers who couldn’t get it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwp00393967iki1i4xy@published data-word-count=51>Sebek: I wore this tight turquoise button-up T-shirt that was almost cropped and a skin-colored unitard I’d rolled down to my waist, only to discover Gillian, who was 50-something, in see-through hose with a thong. When my group went up she pointed at me and said, “You! Thank you, everyone else.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwq003a3967mydzim3t@published data-word-count=37>Robert Hoshour (Tumblebrutus): The audition process went on and on because Gillian Lynn, Trevor Nunn, and Andrew Lloyd Webber would all come over for a [few weeks] and audition people and then they’d go away for months.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwr003b3967w07pgpz6@published data-word-count=39>Ard: It got down to last couple guys and then it was like, “Who has tricks?” I did a roundoff, back handspring, back layout, and landed in the splits. Nobody else had tricks. So they gave me a callback.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwr003c39678yvtxyx9@published data-word-count=54>Whitney Kershaw (Sillabub): I was at the dentist getting my wisdom teeth pulled and they had just given me a relaxant when I got a phone call. My agent said, “You’re going to be one of the principal people in Cats!” When I woke up, I told my husband, “I dreamed I got Cats.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmws003d39673h3ms5ot@published data-word-count=117>Ken Page (Old Deuteronomy): The weekend before they’d be announcing the cast, I went to visit friends on Fire Island. I’m walking down the beach and a guy is walking toward me with two Siamese cats on leashes. I was with my friend Reed Jones, who went on to play Skimbleshanks. Anyway, the cats walked around me three times. Reed and I looked at each other, because we were both waiting to hear about Cats. Monday morning, as I walked in my door, the phone was ringing and it was the production office, asking if I wanted to play Old Deuteronomy. Well, that’s like asking someone, would you like $49 million? I said, “Oh my God, yes.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwt003e39679upkc8m8@published data-word-count=74>Page: They were saying Cher was going to play Grizabella. All kinds of names were being thrown around. After [the cast was announced], I went to visit a friend who’d gone up for Grizabella. She said, “Congratulations, but I have one question: Who the hell is Betty Buckley?” I said, “Well, she’s Grizabella!” I think that Betty and I getting cast surprised the theater community because we weren’t the people anyone was talking about.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buqmwt003f3967fyr0z5y8@published data-word-count=36>Sebek: I was a pretty cocky kid back then.

The cast spent the first days practicing theater exercises meant to help them learn to not just act like cats but to feel, truly, that they were cats. (Buckley got through one such exercise by deciding to channel a sleepy cat, curling up in a sunny spot by a window and taking a nap.) Meanwhile, a separate team began transforming the Winter Garden Theatre into a space that could accommodate Napier’s complex set. There was a tattered billboard, an old car, and a baby buggy, as well as hundreds of props, all of which were oversize. When the performers got to the theater, they tried to learn where everything was so they wouldn’t hurt themselves.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4busze8003u396751wiht9k@published data-word-count=18>Hoshour: The rehearsal period was unusual in that, at first, we’d come in and do these sense-memory exercises.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcqy003z39671bbiqnn8@published data-word-count=10>Ard: We basically crawled around and pretended to be cats.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcqz00403967zjbkarue@published data-word-count=29>Hack: After about a week, one gal wasn’t having it.

He was very, let’s say, temperamental. He would crawl up on the shelf where my wife and I kept our glasses, knock one down, and if you did not come out and scream at him, he’d knock the next one down.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr000433967v8r8ff5n@published data-word-count=30>Anna McNeely (Jennyanydots): Trevor’s thing was that we feel organically that we were cats. He didn’t want us hissing or meowing. He wanted it to be coming from deep inside.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr100443967tp6o1jj9@published data-word-count=33>Donna King (Bombalurina): I got so into character.

I was an acrobat. I remember sitting in the studio watching all these phenomenal performers, thinking, “I don’t know if I belong, but it sure feels good to be here.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr200463967rgdg13yo@published data-word-count=80>Page: At one point I was doing a lot of dancing in the opening sequence. But as things went along, Gillian said, “Darling, we’re going to take you out of the opening.” I said, “Oh no! I wanted to prove I can dance.” She said, “You’re doing very good, darling, but we want you to just lord over the tribe.” I think it was a nice way of saying I wasn’t quite up to the level of the other people.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr300473967s0mfiwnc@published data-word-count=15>Hack: During rehearsals, Willie Rosario, who’d been cast as Skimbleshanks, hurt his knee really badly.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr500483967gu1tmgoh@published data-word-count=68>Hoshour: In the middle of one rehearsal for the Jellicle Ball, Willie went down. There was a scream, and everything in the room stopped. They took him away to the hospital and we were all just sitting there thinking, that could have been any of us. The creative team put in his understudy, Reed Jones, and he became Skimbleshanks. If nothing else, that’ll tighten a cast really quick.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr500493967yyybytsz@published data-word-count=44>Hack: When we got to the theater for the first time we finally saw the actual things they’d been building for weeks. The most difficult thing is we were on a raked stage, meaning it was tilted. There was every opportunity to hurt yourself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d7a/f57/a92cfef945bab1f152eac2154454bb02dd-john-napier-cats-bts.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Set designer John Napier recreated certain elements from the London production (pictured here), including its wasteland look. In both shows, when the theater goes dark at the beginning, the audience is suddenly surrounded by flashing lights meant to approximate cats’ eyes.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr6004a3967h8a1540a@published data-word-count=44>John Napier (set and costume designer): I’d come over to NY to look for spaces we could put the show. I looked at the Armory and old warehouses. But it’s a Broadway musical, and the Shuberts had a theater. So I <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>used the theater</span>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr6004b3967glutkj9e@published data-word-count=24>Taylor: The Shuberts had just renovated the Winter Garden when John came in and said, “We’re going to rip the shit out of this.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr7004c3967n9i2kglq@published data-word-count=42>Napier: I wasn’t interested in doing the show in a proscenium theater with gilding and gold. I needed mystery. The Shuberts constantly told me how much it was costing them. I said, <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>“Well, we’ll find out whether you’ll get your money back!”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr8004d3967uzqp0wcb@published data-word-count=74>Ray Huessy (set design assistant): We painted the entire theater black. We cut a six-foot square hole in the decorative plaster ceiling for Grizabella’s exit to the Heaviside Layer. Most Broadway theaters also have an asbestos curtain that can separate the stage from the audience in case of fire. But we were building the stage out into the house, [so] that wasn’t going to happen. We had to have a fireman at every performance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcr9004e3967upe49n2k@published data-word-count=61>Napier: I had been on a journey to visit some relations, going along this rather derelict part of London, when I saw this old billboard tipped over. You have those moments where you go, ding! It made perfect sense for it to be in a kind of wasteland. It’s a complex set, but it’s a simple set. You’re in one place.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcrb004f3967aj2wc0ga@published data-word-count=98>Huessy: It all boils down to one brilliant idea, and that is to make everything around the cats three times life-size. The car trunk opened up and people crawled out, the oven opened up and dancers ran out. And of course, in the second act, the back wall folded down and covered the stage, so you had a whole different set of scenery. But that’s John Napier. He’s a bit of a madman but also a genius. If he hadn’t come up with this concept, the show could have been kind of embarrassing — the British say twee.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcrc004g39673815b31m@published data-word-count=37>Hoshour: What Trevor Nunn said was that he’d gone to Disney World and saw that people were putting down good money to be transported into a different universe. That’s what he and John Napier wanted to create.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcre004h3967n739d7db@published data-word-count=23>Ard: During rehearsals, there’d be reporters outside, taking pictures. It was maddening, and of course exciting because I felt like I’d finally arrived.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4butcre004i3967t8smb1x7@published data-word-count=22>McNeely: They were very, very careful at the beginning.

Cats’ popularity wasn’t due to the reviews (“It’s quite a musical, but hardly purr-fect,” quipped the New York Post); it grew legendary through word-of-mouth. During the show, performers popped out of holes at audience members’ feet, they jumped in people’s laps, they crawled along banisters. All of this came with challenges. How do you keep a full face of makeup from smearing when you’re dancing so hard you’re perspiring pounds of sweat? How do you maintain your body in order to perform such athletic feats month after month? What do you do when you start slipping off the balcony in the middle of the show?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4buv05r004w39679ztszxwf@published data-word-count=34>Hoshour: There was like nothing like that opening night.

It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Everyone had been so unrecognizable under their costumes that it was like [watching] ghosts dance on and off the stage. I’d see Tim Scott, Reed Jones, dancing through, and then have to remind myself, no, they’re gone. As far as the whole history of Cats in that period, AIDS will be the thing that I’ll remember.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bv0m2x007b3967yc8xlqsl@published data-word-count=34>Hack: It made us feel that we better stay, keep our job, because we might never get one again.

I went to see it later and afterward I said to Steve Hack, “That guy in the role I played was doing a heck of a lot of acrobatics.” He said [in fact], “They had to take stuff out when you left.” That’s what your memory does. I couldn’t even remember what I’d once been capable of. When you’re young and energetic you’ll do anything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bv0m30007e3967igr4m00y@published data-word-count=30>Kershaw: To this day, if I have a nightmare, it’s that I can’t remember my steps in Cats.

But I ended up directing eight other productions of Cats, and spread out over the years it was fun. It was always so exciting to watch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bv0m32007g39675b2450k6@published data-word-count=27>Napier: I remember thinking, We’d be lucky to get away with this. It’s astounding to me that, even to this day, there is a demand for Cats.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bv0m35007h39671wrrlvu4@published data-word-count=26>Taylor: There’s always been the knock that there’s no plot. But there’s something that resonates. A show doesn’t run all those years unless it’s emotionally involving.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck4bv0m38007i39671ifpuwij@published data-word-count=33>Kershaw: For children, it has an aliveness they tap into. For older people, it speaks to the tender fragility of life. It became kind of a joke.
