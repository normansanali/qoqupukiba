While Miley owes most of her fanbase to her character Miley Ray Stewart in the Disney Channel Television series Hannah Montana which gained worldwide commercial success, she has also acquired recognition for her work as a musician.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyrus' relationship with Hemsworth was never a secret affair, nor was their split. <a href=#>Miley has always been candid about her life events, </a>whether her sexuality or her divorce from ex-beau Liam. Since <a href=#>she believes in being as open with her fans as she can, </a>a gesture that her admirers often reciprocate by praising her openness.</p><p><strong>Updated on February 2nd, 2022 by Abigail Thomas: </strong>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, despite their long history, were only married for a very short time. They originally dated when they were teenagers after meeting on set of The Last Song in 2009. The first of many breakups occurred in 2010, but they got back together and became engaged in 2012. They officially called off the engagement in late 2013 after previously postponing the wedding. The celebrity couple then secretly got married in 2018, but were divorcing within a year. Now, years later, Cyrus has released a song called "Flowers" in preparation for her upcoming album. The song <a href=#>seems to discuss her previous relationship with Hemsworth</a>, and fans are freaking out over the details and secrets in the song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=liam-and-miley-met-as-teenagers>Liam And Miley Met As Teenagers</h2><p>While people know that Miley Cyrus met Liam Hemsworth on the set of the 2009 movie The Last Song, they are unaware that it was not the duo's first encounter with each other, as they had met when Hemsworth was auditioning for the movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus And Other Musicians Who Gave Fans The Best Songs About Moving On</a></span></p><p>During an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres show in 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 7 Things singer recalled her first interaction with her then-boyfriend Liam.</a></p><p>"I met him and he opened the door for me and I was like, 'I have been in LA for three years and I don't think any guy has actually opened the door for me,'" the songstress told Ellen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Liam has] become my best friend in the whole wide world," Cyrus had told Parade in an interview in 2010.
