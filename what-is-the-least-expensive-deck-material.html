Hardwood decking usually costs 1.25 trees for a single deck. In contrast, TimberTech boards crafted from recycled woods and plastics present no damage to real wood.<h2>Is Trex decking worth the money?</h2>Trex decks are worth it because you get what you pay for. They cost more than a treated lumber one, making up for your extra outlay of cash at the onset, and will last for years longer than the average treated deck, letting you more than recoup your investment. Trex decks are also low maintenance.<h2>Is Trex cheaper than cedar?</h2>Unlike pressure-treated wood that is cheaper than Trex decking, cedar is not.
