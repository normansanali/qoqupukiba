<time>18 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Former NFL star, Tony Gonzalez ranks among the greatest tight ends. There is, however, a section of fans who regard him as the all-time greatest instead of just one of the greatest. Now a member of the Chiefs Hall of Fame and Pro Ball Hall of fame, Gonzalez broke several NFL records during his 17-year professional football career. Remarkably, Gonzalez made it to Pro Bowl the same season he became enlisted in NFL; the first tight end to ever achieve the feat. Following his retirement in 2013, Tony started working as a football analyst. He hosted NFL Today, a CBS pregame show until 2016 after which he joined Fox Sport’s team of studio analysts in May 2017, precisely hosting the Fox NFL Kickoff pregame show.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who Did Tony Gonzalez Play for?">Who Did Tony Gonzalez Play for?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Atlanta Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title=Height>Height</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Tony Gonzalez’s Wife and Brother">Tony Gonzalez’s Wife and Brother</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="Tony Gonzale’s Net Worth">Tony Gonzale’s Net Worth</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-did-tony-gonzalez-play-for></span><strong>Who Did Tony Gonzalez Play for?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former American football tight end was born as Anthony David Gonzalez on the 27th day of February 1976. Gonzalez started engaging in athletics right from an early age. He later became an active athlete from his days at the Huntington Beach High School. As a high school student, he played football and basketball and was lettered in both.</p><p>On proceeding to the University of California, Berkeley, Gonzalez continued playing both football and basketball but later settled for the former for his post-college career. During his years of professional football, Tony Gonzalez played for just two teams in the National Football League (NFL), namely Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kansas-city-chiefs></span><strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Beginning his professional career in 1997, Kansas City Chiefs were the first to draft Gonzalez. Picked at number 13 in round 1, Tony ranked among the top 15 selections of the year’s NFL draft. The same season he joined the Chiefs, Gonzales made it to the NFL All-Rookie Team.</p><p>Two years later (during the 1999 season), he earned his first Pro Bowl selection as a First-Team All-Pro, an honor he also received in the next nine consecutive seasons (2000-2008) with five First-Team All-Pro selections.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=atlanta-falcons></span><strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After spending ten seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, Tony Gonzales joined the Atlanta Falcons in 2009. The Chiefs traded him for a 2010 NFL Draft second-round pick. In his first main season game for the Falcons, Tony broke records when he became the first NFL tight end ever to record 11,000 receiving yards. Gonzalez also emerged the first NFL tight end to record 1,000 career reception. Notwithstanding, his overall career statistics witnessed a decline at Atlanta Falcons, causing him to miss a Pro Bowl selection for the first time in ten years that season. He, however, returned the following season being 2010.</p><p>On November 11, 2012, Tony Gonzalez once again broke NFL records by emerging the first tight end to catch a hundred touchdown passes. He soon after earned his first career playoff win after the Falcons’ defeated the Seattle Seahawks 30-28 on January 13, 2013. The end of the next season saw Gonzalez bow out of professional football, with a total of 14 Pro Bowl selections. He also retired as one of the top 10 players in several receiving categories including yards, receptions, and touchdowns.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong>Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tony Gonzalez is an impressively tall guy.

In addition, he has another son named Nikko with Lauren Sanchez whom he dated prior to October.</p><p>Tony Gonzalez has an older brother named Chris Gonzalez. Tony’s brother Chris is also very passionate about football from childhood. His dream to become a footballer was, however, halted by a severe injury he sustained in a car crash at seven. Following the ugly incident, Chris appears to be living his much treasured but cut-short dream through his younger brother, Tony. The two of them are very close and lived together most of the times.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chris Gonzales is working towards becoming a firefighter and paramedic expert. Unlike Tony, however, Chris has largely lived his life away from media attention. In 2015 the brothers starred in Showtime’s television documentary, Play It Forward.
