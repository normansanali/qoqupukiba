She is the television personality and reality star of the show but she is better defined as an animal lover. She is the founder of <strong>Villalobos Rescue Center</strong> which is famous for giving shelter to pit bull. She is also the person responsible for the most successful Pit Bull rescue in the US.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Tia's show is a success and her rescue center is as well, but it has not always been easy for Tia. Find out about her road to success and her net worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Founder Of Villalobos; Tia's Career</h2><p>Tia grew up under the care of her stepmother. She and her stepmother both shared fondness for animals and they used to adopt dogs and stray cats from her neighborhood. From a young age, she was an avid enthusiast in animal welfare and her stepmother had similar feelings for animals as well. At the age of 17, Tia left her home to help stray and endangered animals.</p><p>Tia's life was not easy after she left home and she had to struggle to keep a place and keep her entourage of animals she had rescued. At times, she found herself to be homeless and living in her van. She got involved in a bad circle becoming a member of a suit-wearing gang.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Tia managed to leave that life behind and trained to become a truck driver in the U.S. Army. After completing her service in the army, she accepted the job of a youth gang counselor.</p><p>Tia's love for animal came around in a full circle when she had a fated meeting with <strong>Tatanka</strong>, a pit bull, during her visit to a Los Angeles Animal Shelter with her daughters. The scary looking dog was playing with her daughter and bringing happiness to them. It made her adopt the dog. This meeting eventually led to the establishment of the for stray and abused dogs.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Tia's goodwill did not limit to rescuing the animals but the misguided humans as well. She helped to take on parolees to do community service and helped to get them on the right track.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><p>She would also be the savior of the lost souls amongst the lives of animals that she saved. Her story and heroism caught the eyes of magazines and reality TV producers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Tia had declined to work on reality shows at first as she wanted to keep her life private. However, diminishing donations and bearing the responsibility of looking after rescued animals, social misfits and her own family, she had to give in and hence&nbsp;began airing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The show has been successful and most importantly been a huge help to keep her rescue center running.</p><h2>Net Worth of The Rescuer Tia Torres</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Tia, being the star of one of the successful show has an estimated net worth of $300,000. She has gained much fame through her show and has been a&nbsp;guest on <a href=# rel=noopener>Ellen Degeneres</a>&nbsp;show.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>In the past, Tia had to use up all her savings to keep her rescue center running with her having to overdraw from her bank account as well. There have been many points in her life where she has been broke and homeless especially during her younger years.</p><p>Now, the animal lover lives a better life and tries to rescue and give dogs a better environment. She is sure to touch better heights in the future. We wish her all the best.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGitoqSclrmwrs6sZKivnpq%2FbsXEmqmsZaSerm7Azqupnqtdmq6zusinnmaeoqS6brTEq2Spqp%2BbsrS%2FyKilZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2armJp6tLTEZp%2Baq12WsKm1xK%2BcnQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvillalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvillalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvillalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvillalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvillalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvillalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jamie-lynn-spears-knife-scandal-saved-friends-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jamie-lynn-spears-knife-scandal-saved-friends-life.html>Jamie Lynn Spears Wasn't Afraid to Take Her Life Into Her Hands To Save A Friend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dixie-damelio-responds-to-ariana-grandes-shade-at-tiktok-stars.html>Dixie D'Amelio Responds to Ariana Grande's Shade at TikTok Stars</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dixie-damelio-responds-to-ariana-grandes-shade-at-tiktok-stars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
