However, additional details about the actors' careers and personal lives beyond the show may not be as well-known.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Stranger Things’ Jamie Campbell Bower Dated This Harry Potter Star">Stranger Things’ Jamie Campbell Bower Dated This Harry Potter Star</a></span></p><p>For example, Maya Hawke is the <a href=#>talented daughter of actors Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke</a>. Millie Bobby Brown has her own makeup company called Florence by Mills. Millie is also one of four English actors in the main cast. The others are <a href=#>Jamie Campbell Bower</a>, Charlie Heaton, and <a href=#>Joseph Quinn</a>. The list goes on. One interesting detail that is common in many of the stars' lives is that they are also musicians. So many, in fact, that it's almost as if being musically inclined was a requirement for being on the show.</p><h2 id=maya-hawke><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Maya Hawke</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maya Hawke is not only fantastic in her role as the hilariously endearing Robin Buckley in Stranger Things, but she is also a talented musician. Maya released her first album, Blush, in 2020. Her next album, MOSS, is due to be released on September 23rd. MOSS will feature her single "Thérèse," which was released this past June. She said that title MOSS stems from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"green blanket of memories and feelings"</a> she's accumulated over the past few years.</p><h2 id=joe-keery><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Joe Keery</span></h2><p>Joe Keery, who plays Maya Hawke's on-screen best friend Steve Harrington, also has a music career of his own. Joe, AKA Djo, also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a single in late June.</a> "Change" will be featured on his second solo album, DECIDE, which will be released on September 16th - just a week before Maya's. Joe's first solo album, TWENTY TWENTY, was released in 2019, and it came after he left the Chicago rock band Post Animal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Gaten Matarazzo's Amazing Transformation Since Stranger Things Season 1">Gaten Matarazzo's Amazing Transformation Since Stranger Things Season 1</a></span></p><h2 id=caleb-mclaughlin><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Caleb McLaughlin</span></h2><p>Caleb McLaughlin also has a budding solo music career. He has released two singles: "Soul Travel" and "Neighborhood." When speaking to Complex about his music, Caleb said,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "I also want people to know that I'm not just an actor who enjoys music, this is a spiritual thing for me."</a> For the production and writing of both of these singles, he has worked with the producer RASHAD. Earlier on in his career, Caleb <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">played Young Simba</a> in The Lion King on Broadway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-heaton><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Charlie Heaton</span></h2><p>Charlie Heaton was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drummer for the bands Comanechi </a>and Half Loon. When he was in Comanechi, he met his former girlfriend, drummer and singer Akiko Matsuura. Charlie and Akiko share a son named Archie. Though it seems that Charlie is mainly focused on acting for now, he did participate in The Shadowboxers' virtual cover of The 1975's "If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)" during the COVID-19 lockdowns.</p><h2 id=jamie-campbell-bower><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jamie Campbell Bower</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Campbell Bower gave an impressive performance on this season of Stranger Things, and it might be surprising that acting isn't his only talent. Like his cast mates, Jamie has released a few solo songs. He has one EP called Prologue (Live from the Alter) that was released in 2020. He recently released a second EP with two songs called "Run On" and "Devil In Me." He was also a part the group Counterfeit from 2015 to 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Stranger Things Stars Have Both Been Arrested">These Stranger Things Stars Have Both Been Arrested</a></span></p><h2 id=finn-wolfhard><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Finn Wolfhard</span></h2><p>Finn Wolfhard is currently member of the group The Aubreys with his former Calpurnia bandmate Malcolm Craig. The Aubreys released an album last year called Karaoke Alone. This album came after their three-song EP Soda & Pie, which featured their single "Loved One." Finn told NME that his musical relationship with Malcolm is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"a little telepathic."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gaten-matarrazzo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Gaten Matarrazzo</span></h2><p>Gaten is in a <a href=#>band called Work in Progress</a>. There are also many videos of Gaten singing live online - whether he's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singing "Misery Business" with Paramore</a> and his band or singing Godspell's "All for the Best" with fellow actor Joshua Colley. Before joining Stranger Things, Gaten was in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Les Misérables on Broadway. He will be returning to Broadway this summer to star in Dear Evan Hansen.</p><h2 id=sadie-sink><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sadie Sink</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Caleb and Gaten, Sadie was also on Broadway before Stranger Things. She played Annie in the musical Annie. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Sadie revealed that, before she became a professional actress, she and her brother used to put on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own renditions of Wicked</a> and other shows for their parents.</p><h2 id=eduardo-franco><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Eduardo Franco</span></h2><p>Though Eduardo Franco was new to the cast this season, he fit right in as a fellow musician. He is a member of the group Dumb B**ches With Internet. So far, the rap duo has released two albums. Their first album, FOOLS, was released in 2021. Their second, three-song album, The Most Album Ever, was released this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joseph-quinn><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Joseph Quinn</span></h2><p>Although Joseph Quinn is not a member of any band, Stranger Things fans will be pleased to hear that he was actually playing the guitar for *that* scene at the end of Season 4. He told RadioTimes.com that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"practiced manically for months until [they] ended up shooting the thing."</a> Though he did not play the entire solo on his own, he used the skills he'd learned since he started playing guitar as a kid to nail the scene.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="How Did Millie Bobby Brown Meet Boyfriend Jake Bongiovi?">How Did Millie Bobby Brown Meet Boyfriend Jake Bongiovi?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqraqRo7Smvoytn6Kml6h6tMDAq6pmr5ikeqK%2BxGaYpaufYrq2v8icoJqmo2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstranger-things-stars-who-are-also-musicians.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstranger-things-stars-who-are-also-musicians.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstranger-things-stars-who-are-also-musicians.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstranger-things-stars-who-are-also-musicians.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstranger-things-stars-who-are-also-musicians.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstranger-things-stars-who-are-also-musicians.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wes-craven-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wes-craven-net-worth-2024.html>Wes Craven Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley-nyfw-ralph-lauren-maroon-velvet-dress.html>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Slays in Maroon Gown</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley-nyfw-ralph-lauren-maroon-velvet-dress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
