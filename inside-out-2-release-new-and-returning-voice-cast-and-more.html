The animation studio shared that Poehler will be returning as the emotion Joy, and that Kelsey Mann is on board to direct. But now much more information is known, including when it will be released!</p><p data-characters=51 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Here’s everything you’ll want to know.</p><h2 id=h-inside-out-2-release-date-casting-details data-injectable=false>Inside Out 2 release date & casting details</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>The film has recently been given a release date and will hit theaters on June 14, 2024. It has also been confirmed that <a href=#>Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader</a> will not be returning to the sequel due to a contract dispute. Their roles of Disgust and Fear will be filled by Liza Lapira and Tony Hale.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Alongside Poehler and Mann is Meg LeFauve, who co-wrote Inside Out with Doctor and Josh Cooley, and is back to write the script for Inside Out 2.</p><h2 id=h-what-will-inside-out-2-be-about data-injectable=false>What will Inside Out 2 be about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Inside-Out-2-110923-1-737d1f1a373348708adc352bcfa91feb.jpeg><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>The sequel is set to follow Riley (Kaitlyn Dias in the original film) as she enters her teenage years. The setup for this sequel was there at the end of the last film, with Joy finally feeling like she had things back under control. That is, until a new console is brought in with the addition of the “puberty button,” leaving Joy and her fellow emotions wondering whether or not they should press it. Well, they did. Obviously.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=72 data-injectable=false>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> about the next step for the characters, Poehler said:</p><p>“We’re going to have what it feels like to be a teenager, the new emotions that live inside a young person’s brain. In many ways, it was really exciting. We knew exactly where we were. We go to the teen brain and we see the madness that lives inside there.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How will Inside Out 2 tackle adolescence?</h2><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Teenage years are difficult, and that’s for numerous reasons including our changing bodies and brain chemistry. Looking back on her own teen years, Poehler said she was often “feeling frustrated” or “like you’re very in between.” She remembers the pressures of being a teenager:</p><p>“There’s a lot of things you want to have move quicker than they are. I remember that feeling of wanting to grow up fast, which is such a funny feeling now. You wanted time to go fast. You wanted life to move. You wanted to move. Sometimes, you get stuck in a system or a group that won’t let you do that. I think a lot frustration. I can remember that feeling. Feeling frustration and I know that young people still feel that.”</p><p data-characters=677 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>The first film was praised for its handling of mental health in young children, exploring these themes through the use of emotions personified in Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Fear (Bill Hader), and it went on to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Poehler, a mother to a 12 and 13-year-old herself, has said that the next film will go “deeper” stating that “a lot has happened since the first film in terms of the emotional intelligence and&nbsp;how we think about mental health&nbsp;and how our emotions can affect us physically, and what’s really going on inside our head.”</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>This sequel will most likely be praised for the same, given that it has been confirmed by the trailer that it will focus on <a href=#>new emotions</a> like <a href=#>anxiety</a>. Seeing such a huge movie deal with mental health struggles will definitely be a positive step for the field and for validating the struggles of many.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Inside Out 2 arrives in theaters on June 14, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8inqqKclWK8tsCMa2SrnZyarrSxjKecsGWRo7FuvsStrKummaO0bsLOopqeZZOWwLV5wKebZqWfp7Jw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-out-2-release-new-and-returning-voice-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-out-2-release-new-and-returning-voice-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-out-2-release-new-and-returning-voice-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-out-2-release-new-and-returning-voice-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-out-2-release-new-and-returning-voice-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-out-2-release-new-and-returning-voice-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jay-norths-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jay-norths-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html>Jay Norths net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./inger-stevens.html>Inger Stevens</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./inger-stevens.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
