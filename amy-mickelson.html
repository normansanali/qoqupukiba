| Educational Background</h3><p>When she was in her mid-teens, Amy attended Harvest Park Middle School, located at Valley Ave, Pleasanton, California.</p><p>Following that, she was the freshman princess of Foothill high school in 1986.</p><p>Dave Ferry, a former student at the same institution and Greatest Man on Campus (GMOC) in his freshman year, remembers Mickelson.</p><p>He stated that Amy’s sincere, sweet behavior overlooked her beauty.</p><p>Dave said that he still remembers the first day Amy came to school. He said that all the popular boys would be in their bunch during lunchtime, and all the popular girls would have their group.</p><p>“All the boys went mingling over by her. So the popular girls panicked, introduced themselves, and all was right with the world,” Dave further commented.</p><p>Eventually, Amy Mickelson moved to Hillcrest High School, located in Midvale, Utah. She graduated from Hillcrest in 1990.</p><p>Regarding her college education, initially, she attended the University of Utah but did not last long there.</p><p>She transferred to Arizona State University, where she met her husband of 27 years.</p><h2>Amy Mickelson’s Career</h2><p>During her time at Arizona State University, Amy used to be a cheerleader. Amy was a cheerleader for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p><p>Since her days at the Arizona State, she aspired to become an actress.</p><p>Following her passion for acting, she debuted in a film entitled Sunset (1988). Sadly, the movie failed to make an impression.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/26869790_327350791092952_6147577752384962560_n-e1632812904441.jpg><p>Apparently, that was the end of her career as an actress. Perhaps her acting skills were not that great, or maybe she found something more interesting than acting.</p><p>Mickelson now works as a social worker and runs a foundation named after herself and her husband.</p><p>The pro golfer’s wife has also established a foundation that raises funds for breast cancer women.</p><h2>Amy Mickelson’s Net Worth</h2><p>Amy Mickelson’s net worth is estimated to be around a million dollars, but our expertise suggests that her actual net worth might be upwards of 500 thousand dollars.</p><p>She played a minor role for her debut film, which did not pay much as it was an indie film, and her onscreen time was not much.</p><p>Besides that, she does not have any source of income unless she has her hands on some real estate or shares in companies.</p><p>On the other hand, her husband, <a href=#>Phil Mickelson</a>‘s net worth is estimated to be around 400 million dollars.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Read more about Phil Mickelson’s net worth in this following article >></strong></a></p><h3>Battling Breast Cancer</h3><p>In 2009, Amy was diagnosed with deadly breast cancer.

The event was held at the Augusta National Golf Course.</p><p>Amy, along with her three children, showed support and encouraged Phil. Likewise, <a href=#>Phil Mickelson</a> went on to snatch the trophy and won a 1.35 million dollars prize.</p><p>In 2012, she started attending Phil’s matches after her health conditions began showing signs of improvement.</p><p>Her health got significantly better, and she eventually recovered from breast cancer.</p><p>The 2012 Ryder Cup was the first match she attended after her recovery.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Francesca Schiavone, a retired tennis star, also had breast cancer; read about it here >></strong></a></p><h3>Support for Breast Cancer at Phil’s Match</h3><p>During the 2009 PGA tour, Amy’s husband, <a href=#>Phil Mickelson</a>, and his colleagues and their wives wore pink in Amy’s honor. As a result, the event was named ‘Pink Out.’</p><p>This special honorary event was held in Fort Worth, Texas, at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial.</p><p>Tears were streaming down the couple’s face when they heard that the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, PGA Tour, and tour wives organized the event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/11410380_1442557862730572_1510392720_n-e1632813024679.jpg><p>“We both had tears rolling down our faces,” said Phil during an interview.</p><p>He added that the ‘Pink Out’ was an incredibly thoughtful gesture for Amy and the two hundred thousand women who have breast cancer each year.</p><h3>Phil and Amy Mickelson Foundation</h3><p>The Phil and Amy Mickelson Foundation recently donated a million dollars to 14 charity organizations in Coachella valley.</p><p>The proceedings from the 2020 American Express tournament were donated.</p><p>American Express tournament was held in the January of 2020, which successfully raised over a million dollars. Various charities, including the Boys and Girls Club of Coachella Valley, Alzheimer’s Association Coachella Valley, and Coachella Valley Rescue Mission, received the donation.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, in November of 2020, it was announced that the proceedings of the 2021 American Express would be donating to multiple charities based in Coachella Valley.</p><p>It was said that the 2021 donation would focus on local non-profit organizations.</p><p>Before the 2020 American Express tournament, Phil and Amy Mickelson Foundation became the official host organization for The American Express.</p><h2>Phil and Amy Mickelson’s Relationship</h2><p>When Phil and Amy came across each other, Amy was a member of the cheerleading team for the Pheonix Suns of the National Basketball Association.</p><p>On the other hand, Phil was already a great professional golfer by then, but Amy had no idea about it.</p><p>“I thought he worked in a golf course shop,” Amy thought.</p><p>Amy was just a new junior when the two met each other. Phil was in his senior year.</p><p>The first date the couple went on was a tennis match between them. Could not expect any less from a pro athlete!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/12545252_832675300174664_534663920_n-e1632813140217.jpg><p>Later, <a href=#>Phil Mickelson</a> invited Amy to Bob Hope Celebrity Pro-Am event held in Palm Springs, CA.</p><p>As time went on, the two started growing feelings for each other, eventually falling in love.</p><p>Phil and Amy dated for four years before getting married in 1996, on the 16th of November.
