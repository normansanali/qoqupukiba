Born in an English farming community, Huntington-Whiteley has come a long way since childhood – she has enjoyed a truly spectacular breakout as a teen, and gone on to a career as a high-profile professional model and actress. Over the years, Huntington-Whiteley has featured as one of the “Victoria’s Secret” angels and the female face of the British luxury fashion house “Burberry”, in addition to working with “Loewe”, “Miss Sixty”, “VS Online” and “Godiva”.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=rosie-huntington-whiteley-net-worth-5-million></span>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Net Worth $5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Recently, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley made her first serious appearance in the film industry, starring as the female lead in Michael Bay’s 2011 science-fiction action film “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” alongside actors Shia LaBeouf and Josh Duhamel. Though the critical reception to her acting was mixed, the role certainly gave Rosie Huntington-Whitley’s net worth a huge boost, and her acting career looks set to continue.</p><p>Though Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a world-famous model and actress today, her childhood was less glamorous. Born on April 18, 1987 in Plymouth, England, Huntington-Whiteley was brought up on a farm in the County of Devon. The model has been quoted admitting that she was bullied in school for having a double surname, and for her full lips and small breasts. Ultimately, the joke was on Huntington-Whiteley’s bullies – at the age of 16, Rosie got her first modelling job with “Levi’s”, featuring in a commercial. With her early entrance into the modelling industry, it was not surprising when, in 2006, Huntington-Whiteley began to model for “Victoria’s Secret”. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s real breakout, however, would come in 2008, when she was featured in the “Burberry” autumn and winter campaign. Such astounding and early success substantially increased Huntington-Whiteley’s net worth, and cemented her position among the world’s most famous professional models.</p><p>Since then, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has continued to enjoy a prestigious and successful career. In 2010, Huntington-Whiteley became an official “Victoria’s Secret” angel. Next year, she not only had her first solo appearance on the cover of “British Vogue” magazine, but also featured in a leading role in the science-fiction action film “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”, directed by Michael Bay and starring Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and the voice actor Peter Cullen. While Huntington-Whiteley’s performance received its share of criticisms from professional film critics, the model and actress is poised to continue her career in film with the 2015 action film “Mad Max”, produced by George Miller and also featuring acclaimed actors Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.</p><p>How rich is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley? Currently, Huntington-Whiteley’s net worth is estimated to be over $5 million, with some sources maintaining it may be as high as $8 million as of 2014. Huntington-Whiteley certainly leads the glamorous lifestyle to match her wealth, owning an apartment in New York City with an estimated value of $860,000. Her car is a pricy Audi S8, valued at $150,000. As Huntington-Whiteley remains one of the world’s best-known models – awarded first place on “Maxim Magazine’s” “Hot 100” list in 2011 – her net worth seems set to continue growing in the future.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 18, 1987</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Plymouth, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>117 lbs (53 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Model, Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Tavistock College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Fiona Huntington-Whiteley, Charles Andrew Huntington-Whiteley</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Toby Huntington-Whiteley, Florence Huntington-Whiteley</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Jason Statham</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Rosie Huntington , Rosie Alice Huntington-Whiteley , Rose</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/Rosie.H.W</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>http://www.twitter.com/rosiehw</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/rosiehw</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://imdb.com/name/nm2492819</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Glamour Award for Editor’s Special</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Teen Choice Award for Choice Summer Movie Star: Female</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>, Transformers</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Deep sultry British accent</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Statuesque, model-like figure</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Dark blonde hair, blue eyes and full lips</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>When I fell into modeling, because I wanted to work in fashion. I wanted to do styling or make-up. I ended getting picked up to be a model instead during my work experience.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>When I started modeling, I was definitely heavier. I was quite voluptuous in fact. I had a real baby face and baby fat. But I was a baby! I was told I had to get into better shape, but I’m quite stubborn so I didn’t.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I’m not going to change my teeth or get a nose job. That manufactured perfection does nothing for me.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You can get bullied as a young model, but there was a point where I found my voice, effectively.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I can’t remember a time where I really battled with my body, but I can remember being asked to lose weight and battling with the advice. It hurt me. Especially as my baby fat naturally melted away as I got older.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I’d like to think that I’m brave. That’s a really wonderful personality trait to have. I would love to think I’m the type of person to go rescue someone.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Well, it’s a day-to-day thing. I don’t feel comfortable in my body today at all. Any woman will tell you she has her good and bad days and today I did not feel like I looked my best or felt radiant inside or outside.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Hopefully, I’ll get to make another movie, so we’ll see. But modeling – all the actresses are taking everything over now, with all the modeling endorsements and magazine covers.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Being on a Michael Bay set is… well, it’s the only set I’ve ever been on. But I would imagine there’s no set that’s run quite like it. It’s big, it’s loud, it’s powerful, it’s intense, it’s dirty, it’s hot, it’s sweaty – and it’s really exciting. There’s never a dull moment; there’s never a quiet moment.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>I have the same attitude with work – I like to go to work, I like to work really hard, I like to give everything my all, I like to try things that are new, you know.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>I don’t even think when I’m walking down the runway. I don’t really breathe either.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>I went along to the audition and I had one page of lines, and I didn’t think it went particularly well.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>It helps to have someone who wants to understand your job and support it. I’ve never really been concerned about cracking under the pressure and turning to the dark side though. I’ve never been a big drinker and I’ve never done drugs. I like to go out and dance, but I’m always the person that needs to go to bed first. I’m not a party girl. I want to pay my bills and make my family proud. I’ve got no other criteria apart from that.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>I’m not here to win a popularity contest. I’m here to work and have a career. Let the haters hate. I’m ready for the criticism.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>[on being taller than her co-star Shia LaBeouf] I had to wear heels the whole way through filming, when it came to our kissing scene, I said “Please Michael, let me take my shoes off. I feel so unelegant and I feel so unfeminine,”… and he said “No. You’re giving small men across America hope.”.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>[on landing the lead female role in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)] It was a crazy opportunity that was handed to me and spent seven months making the movie with a great cast and a great director.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Engaged to Jason Statham [January 10, 2016].</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Rosie’s four years younger brother, Toby, is also a model.
