The Shop With Us team aims to highlight products and services our readers might find interesting and useful, such as <a href=#>wedding-guest outfits</a>, <a href=#>purses</a>, <a href=#>plus-size swimsuits</a>, <a href=#>women's sneakers</a>, <a href=#>bridal shapewear</a>, and <a href=#>perfect gift ideas</a> for everyone in your life. Product and service selection, however, is in no way intended to constitute an endorsement by either Us Weekly or of any celebrity mentioned in the post.</p><p>The Shop With Us team may receive products free of charge from manufacturers to test. In addition, Us Weekly receives compensation from the manufacturer of the products we write about when you click on a link and then purchase the product featured in an article. This does not drive our decision as to whether or not a product or service is featured or recommended. Shop With Us operates independently from the advertising sales team. We welcome your feedback at <a href=#>ShopWithUs@usmagazine.com</a>. Happy shopping!</p><p>Please note: Information below is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or health condition.</p><p>See tips and information <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">from the CDC</a>.</p><p>So many of our favorite fashion brands are stepping up and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">making face coverings</a>, and encouraging everyone to do their part and wear a mask in the process. Just as a quick reminder, the CDC recommends that <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">you wear a secure mask</a> covering your nose and mouth whenever you’re out in public and can’t maintain proper social distancing. Of course, washing your hands as much as possible is still seriously critical!</p><p>We truly admire that major companies have shifted their production to focus on developing helpful products, and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Tory Burch is the latest</a> to come out with an amazing printed mask set!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/facemasks.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Printed Face Mask, Set of 5</a> with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$35</a>, available from Tory Burch!</strong></p><p>Tory Burch <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">designed these face coverings</a> to tie in with the summer season. They are all so cute, we actually think they will make wearing<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;masks</a> fun and fashionable! You can seamlessly match them with other pieces from Tory Burch’s summer line, which goes to show how much thought the brand put into these products. They are made from a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">moisture-wicking material</a> that’s lightweight and comfortable, and the ear loops on each side are also adjustable so you can get the perfect fit.</p><p>But the best part about <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">these masks</a> is that when you pick up the set, a portion of the money goes to two wonderful organizations. Out of the $35 price tag, $10 is split evenly between the International Medical Corps and the Tory Burch Foundation. The first organization is a nonprofit that works to give aid to those affected by war, natural disaster or disease, and the funds are specifically being donated to help expand medical treatment and equipment to fight COVID-19 in the United States.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Printed Face Mask, Set of 5</a> with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$35</a>, available from Tory Burch!</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, the Tory Burch Foundation is dedicated to empowering women entrepreneurs through capital, mentorship and other networking resources. They have also launched an initiative to provide resources specifically related to businesses impacted by COVID-19, which is truly admirable.</p><p>Tory Burch also gives a full breakdown of the production, handling and shipping costs for full transparency. So basically, these masks are a 100% not-for-profit product. Not only will you look adorable when you wear any of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">these masks</a>, you’ll feel good knowing that your money is being put to great use.
