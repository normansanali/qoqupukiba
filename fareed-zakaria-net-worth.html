He has worked as a columnist and editor for Foreign Affairs, Newsweek and TIME. He presents the program “Fareed Zakaria’s GPS” (2008 – present) aired on CNN. Zakaria has been working as a journalist since 1992.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Fareed Zakaria? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of his wealth is as much as $4 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2014.</p><h3>Fareed Zakaria Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the boy was raised in Bombay. His mother, Fatima Zakaria, worked on the editorial staff of the Bombay Times and the Sunday edition of the Times of India entitled The Sunday Times. His late father, Rafiq Zakaria, was a politician and writer. Fareed has one sister and two brothers. After high school Zakaria moved to the USA to study history at Yale University. In 1984, he was the president of the debating society of the Yale Political Union. He later graduated from Harvard University in 1993, earning his PhD majoring in International Relations.</p><p>From 1992 to 2000, he worked as editor of Foreign Affairs magazine. Zakaria became known when he wrote a cover story entitled “Why They Hate Us”, about the attacks on the 11th September in Newsweek magazine published in October 2001. He was a columnist for the American edition of Newsweek and the editor of the international edition. In 2010, he left Newsweek to work for the magazine TIME. Since 2008, he has presented his own television show “Fareed Zakaria’s GPS”. He has made documentaries aired on HBO.</p><p>However, in the summer of 2012, Zakaria was suspended by TIME and CNN on suspicion of plagiarism. Cam Edwards, who works for the National Rifle Association, found out that a column by Zakaria entitled “The Case for Gun Control”, was in part an article which was written by Jill Lepore in the spring of 2012 for The New Yorke. After Zakaria had apologized for this, all his other pieces for TIME and CNN were also checked for plagiarism with negative results, and he returned as a columnist and presenter. Prior to this, he has been involved in other controversies discussing the role of the people who supported the invasion of Iraq (in 2006) as well as during the debate on the Park51 Islamic Centre (in 2010). Regardless, his net worth grew steadily.</p><p>Moreover, Zakaria adds to his net worth as an author and editor of books. In 1997, his first book entitled “The American Encounter: The United States and the Making of the Modern World Essays from 75 Years of Foreign Affairs” co-edited with James F. Hoge was published, and a year later, Fareed has released “From Wealth to Power” (1998). All in all, he has written five books; recently, the book “In Defense of a Liberal Education” (2015) was released.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Zakaria, he is married to Paula Throckmorton, and they have three children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.024221453287><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Fareed Zakaria</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 20, 1964</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Bombay, Maharashtra, India</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Journalist, Writer, Author, Commentator, Editor, Television producer</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Cathedral and John Connon School, Yale University, Harvard University (1993)</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Indian</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Paula Throckmorton (m. 1997-)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Omar, Lila, Sofia</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Rafiq Zakaria, Fatima Zakaria</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Arshad Zakaria, Tasneem Zakaria Mehta</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Fareed Rafiq Zakaria</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/fareedzakaria</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/fareedzakaria</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27450980392157><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/117956023123721221491</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm1821472</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Peabody Award (2012), Padma Bhushan (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>News & Documentary Emmy Award for Outstanding Interview (2009, 2013)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Foreign Exchange", “Fareed Zakaria's GPS” (2008 – present), Park51 Islamic Centre (in 2010)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=21.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=13><td>1</td><td>Those urging the U.S. to intervene in Syria are certain of one thing: if we had intervened sooner, things would have been better in that war-torn country. Had the Obama Administration gotten involved earlier, there would be less instability and fewer killings. We would not be seeing, in John McCain's words,' atrocities that are on a scale that we have not seen in a long, long time'. In fact, we have seen atrocities much worse than those in Syria very recently - in Iraq under U.S. occupation, only a few years ago. The U.S. was about as actively engaged in Iraq as is possible, and yet more terrible things happened there than in Syria. All the features of the Syrian civil war that are supposedly the result of U.S. non-intervention also appeared in Iraq despite America's massive intervention there.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>2</td><td>In the days of the Arab Spring, we were all intoxicated by the sight of millions gathered in public squares to protest dictatorial governments. We hoped this would culminate in liberal democracy in the Arab world. Two years later, it's clear the prospects in the region are mixed. It turns out the key is not people power but paper power. The focus should be less on elections and more on constitutions.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>3</td><td>We are creating a vast prisoner underclass in this country, at huge expense, increasingly unable to function in normal society, all in the name of a war we have already lost. If Pat Robertson can admit he was wrong, surely it is not too much to ask the same of America's political leaders.</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>4</td><td>The U.S. has 760 prisoners per 100,000 citizens. That's not just many more than in other developed countries but seven to ten times as many. Japan has 63 per 100,000, Germany has 90, France has 96, South Korea has 97, and Britain - with a rate among the highest - has 153. Even developing countries that are well known for their crime problems have a third of U.S. numbers. Mexico has 208 prisoners per 100,000 citizens, and Brazil has 242. The U.S.'s prison population has quadrupled since 1980. So something has happened in in the past thirty years to push millions of people into prison. That something, of course, is the war on drugs.</td></tr></table><p><a href=# class="shortc-button medium green"><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</a></p><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>Vice</td><td></td><td>TV Series documentary consulting producer -
