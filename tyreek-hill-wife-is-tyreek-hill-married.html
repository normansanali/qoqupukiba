He played football, basketball, and ran track in high school.</p><p>Tyreek Hill attended Garden City Community College in Kansas, where he was a two-time NJCAA All-American as a kick returner. He then transferred to Oklahoma State University, where he played for the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team. In his senior year, Hill recorded a total of 1,811 all-purpose yards and 11 touchdowns, earning him first-team All-Big 12 honors.</p><p>In 2016, Hill was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. He quickly made an impact as a rookie, being named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week in Week 2 of the 2016 season. He finished his rookie season with 61 receptions for 593 yards and six touchdowns, along with 24 rushes for 267 yards and three touchdowns. He also returned 22 kickoffs for 592 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>In 2017, Hill had a breakout season, recording 1,183 receiving yards and seven touchdowns, along with 267 yards and one touchdown on the ground. He was named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro for the first time in his career.</p><p>In 2018, Hill had another solid season, recording 1,479 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns. He was once again named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro.</p><p>The 2019 season saw Hill have another great season, with a total of 1,479 yards and 12 touchdowns, leading the league in receiving touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro for the third consecutive year.</p><p>Hill continued to dominate in the 2020 season, recording 1,276 yards and 15 touchdowns in just 12 games. He also played an instrumental role in the Chiefs winning Super Bowl LIV, scoring a touchdown in the game. He was named to the Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro for the fourth time in his career.</p><p>Off the field, Hill has had his fair share of controversies. In 2014, while he was still in college, he was arrested and pleaded guilty to domestic abuse by strangulation after an altercation with his then-girlfriend. He was sentenced to three years probation. In 2019, there was a child abuse investigation involving Hill and his then-fiancee, but no charges were filed.</p><p>Despite these controversies, Hill continues to be one of the most dynamic and explosive players in the NFL. He is known for his speed, agility, and ability to make big plays, and is considered one of the best wide receivers and return specialists in the league. He has established himself as one of the top playmakers on the Kansas City Chiefs, and has played a key role in the team’s success over the past several years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tyreek Hill Wife: Is Tyreek Hill Married?</h2><p>Tyreek Hill is not married, as of 2022.
