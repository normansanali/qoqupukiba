Her father worked as a lawyer while her mother, Joan Winthrop, was a famous British novelist. She grew up with her two older siblings in Manhattan. Growing up, she always enjoyed music and was heavily influenced by <a href=# title="Bob Dylan Net Worth">Bob Dylan</a>. She was initially attracted to playing the drums but did not begin taking lessons until the age of 14. She attended the Manhattan School of Music for a year before leaving to pursue a professional career in music.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Hawkins initially began her music career working as a professional percussionist for <a href=# title="Bryan Ferry Net Worth">Bryan Ferry</a>. She also was working on her own music and released her first album, "Tongues and Tails," in 1992. The album was very well-received around the world, both by the critics and audiences.

The film was made by director Gigi Gaston. The same year, she was set to release her third album, "Timbre," but the release was delayed by Hawkins' record company, Sony Music, as record executives were unhappy with the finished product. They particularly wanted her to remove the banjo that was featured on one of the tracks. However, Hawkins refused and after a long battle, the album was released in 1999, though Sony refused to promote it.</p><p>Hawkins then left the label and decided to form her own, Trumpet Swan Production. In 2001, she re-released "Timbre" on her own label. The rerelease included remixes, videos, and some new songs. She also released a new album, "Wilderness," in 2004, her first independently recorded and released album.</p><p>She then took a break from releasing music and was generally out of the spotlight for some time. However, she reappeared in 2012 to star as <a href=# title="Janis Joplin Net Worth">Janis Joplin</a> in the play, "Room 105," directed by her friend, Gigi Gaston. She also released new music in 2012, an album entitled "The Crossing."</p><p>The following year, in 2013, Hawkins had a guest-starring role as herself in an episode of the popular comedy series, "Community." In the episode, she performed a number of her famous singles.</p><p>Hawkins continues to tour and completed a sold-out 2019 tour around the United States. She also has a strong international following and appeared on the German television show, "Night Grooves," in 2019, where she performed a few songs and also displayed her impressive drumming talent.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2012, Hawkins stated that she identified as omnisexual though she did not confirm any of the rumors connecting her to various women. She has two children â€“ Dashiell born in 2008 and Esther born in 2015. Esther was conceived using an embryo that Hawkins had frozen 20 years previously.</p><p>Hawkins has been active in politics and activism throughout her life. In 2007, she headlined at the first Los Angeles Women's Music Festival, which supported animal rescue groups and also supported female musicians. She also has been a vocal supporter of <a href=# title="Hillary Clinton Net Worth">Hillary Clinton</a> and re-recorded one of her previous hits in Clinton's honor.</p><p>In 2010, she lent her support to the Waterkeeping Alliance, an organization of water advocates who support the protections of bodies of water and coastlines around the world. She has devoted 100% of the proceeds from her single, "The Land, the Sea, and the Sky," to the alliance. She has also been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ organizations.
