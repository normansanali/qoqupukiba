<time>16 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>I’m currently writing this propped up in my bed with three pillows behind my back and head. I hope I won’t have to move much for the rest of the day. Maybe I’ll see if I can order a wheelchair from DoorDash if for some reason I have to leave my apartment.</p><p>After leaving Yankee Stadium’s 2023 Food and Beverage Media Preview on Wednesday afternoon, I sat on a bench right outside of Gate 6 and contemplated the meaning of life. Was it about consuming ungodly amounts of food, most of which was fried, sweet and/or salty, in the name of creating content? Probably not! But someone has to do the job and my favorite word in the English language is “free.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>I’ve only had one other food critic assignment in my life and that was three years ago when I was the Atlanta Hawks beat writer for The Athletic. I t<a href=#>ried the lemon pepper wings at the iconic strip club Magic City</a> after then-Los Angeles Clippers guard Lou Williams got caught at the establishment while in Atlanta for a funeral. This was during the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NBA</a> bubble. When Williams returned to Orlando, he was forced to spend 10 days in quarantine.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I spent a few hours in Magic City yesterday and totally understand why <a href=#>@TeamLou23</a> wanted wings from a strip club.</p><p>“It’s the magic, baby” is what I learned makes their wings so special.</p><p>Tropikal Delite gave me a recommendation for next time, too.<a href=#>https://t.co/CcV1iwrlmd</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/J75TA4Ddhs</a></p><p>— Chris Kirschner (@ChrisKirschner) <a href=#>July 28, 2020</a></p><p>Wednesday’s assignment was in Yankee Stadium’s Audi Club in left field. Let’s say it has very different views, aesthetically, than my assignment in 2020. But neither assignment was about the views; it was about the food!</p><p>The stadium has numerous new concession items for the 2023 season. I tried them all except for the bleu cheese and bacon burger from Bobby’s Burgers because I think bleu cheese is gross. Judge me if you must. Surprisingly, each of the items sampled by media will be priced below $20 before tax.</p><p>Baseball loves its “plus” stats, so to rank each item, I’m creating Yankee Stadium Concessions+, or YSC+, where the average rating is 100 just as it is for wRC+ or OPS+. So, a 125 YSC+ would be 25 percent better than your average concession stand item. I’m also reviewing each item in order of when I ate it. There was no rhyme or reason why I started with one particular item over the next.</p><p>Let’s taste some food.</p><h2>Chicken tenders with waffle fries</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>FUKU<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 213<strong><br>YSC+: 140 &nbsp;</strong></p><p>I’ve been to FUKU’s brick-and-mortar locations before so this wasn’t a new item to me. I would say I’m a chicken tender connoisseur. FUKU easily has a top-five tender in the fast food space. Popeye’s will always be No. 1 for me. Raising Cane’s is my No. 2 followed by FUKU, Bojangles and, honestly, Dairy Queen. Don’t knock it if you haven’t had them.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Not only does FUKU score major points with the juiciness of their chicken and just the right amount of spice, but their waffle fries might be the No. 1 in the waffle fry category, surpassing Chick-fil-A. If you’re getting tenders at the stadium, opt for these instead of the chicken buckets.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22172227/IMG_0549-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2><strong>Cheesy garlic bread</strong></h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Christian Petroni<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Sections 125, 310<strong><br>YSC+: 207&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Aaron Judge</a> of cheesy garlic bread.

The burrito was quite bland. There was so much rice that also didn’t have much seasoning that it overshadowed the beef barbacoa.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171859/IMG_0554-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>Mexican street mac</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Mac Truck<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 223<strong><br>YSC+: 160&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t really know what to expect with this one: classic mac elbow noodles with pico de gallo, charred corn and crushed-up tortilla chips. It is a banger. The tortilla chips act similarly to toasted bread crumbs on traditional mac and cheese except there’s more crunch with the tortilla crumble. Some may find all of the different textures in this dish a bit much but I thought it was fantastic.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171819/IMG_0551-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>Bacon on a stick</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Yankee Stadium<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Various locations throughout the stadium<strong><br>YSC+: 20</strong></p><p>Really, the only good part about this was the immediate rush of saltiness after biting into it. I despise chewy bacon and the piece I had was tough. Side note: There’s nothing fun about getting a BEC at your bodega and the bacon is chewy. It’s seriously such a downer and an awful start to the day. I had a few more bites of the Mexican mac to increase my happiness after that bite.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>I probably need to get my cholesterol checked after this.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171734/IMG_0558-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Pinstripe vanilla shake</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Yankee Stadium Grand Slam Shakes<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Sections 112, 125, 324<strong><br>YSC+: 115&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was planning on continuing to eat more of the actual food but a tray of milkshakes passed by me and I’m never one to turn down ice cream if it’s in front of my face. I’m more of a chocolate ice cream fan so I was hoping for that instead but I didn’t see any.</p><p>I’d compare vanilla shakes to <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Clarke Schmidt</a>. It’s solid. It’s dependable. It’ll get the job done. But it’s the toppings that really take it to a whole new level, and that’s what Schmidt is hoping that his cutter does for him this year. For the shake, I think crushed-up wafer cookies would make a difference instead of having a whole piece.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22172104/IMG_0560-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>Classic mac and cheese</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Mac Truck<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 223<strong><br>YSC+: 125&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There’s no better description of this mac and cheese other than saying it’s the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>DJ LeMahieu</a> of mac and cheeses. You know what you’re getting if you order this. You’re going to feel confident going back to your seat knowing this was your concession purchase because it’s going to be tasty. The only thing here is there are higher-upside options at Mac Truck if you’re willing to go out of your comfort zone. You have the Mexican mac and buffalo chicken mac right there. Be bold.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171658/IMG_0563-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>Rice bowl</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Mighty Quinn’s<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 132<strong><br>YSC+: 95&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After a brief, but necessary pause, I was back with newfound energy. I grabbed a rice bowl with burnt ends and a side of cole slaw. I had higher expectations for it, much like <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Josh Donaldson</a> last season. I liked the sweet sauce on the burnt ends but it just didn’t do much for me overall.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171605/IMG_0561-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>99 Burger</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Legends Hospitality<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 223<strong><br>YSC+: 175&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Easily the best burger I’ve had at a sporting event. The 99 burger is, obviously, an ode to Judge’s number. The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Yankees</a> will only sell a maximum of 99 of these burgers each game, mainly because they’re made with Wagyu beef and cooked to order. On the burger comes aged cheddar, caramelized onions, a secret sauce and pickles on a brioche bun. The burger I had was cooked so perfectly. If I would have started with this, there’s probably no way I would’ve been able to eat as much as I did because I would’ve grabbed a second burger and just eaten that and called it a day.</p><p>Maybe the best part about this burger? It’s $19.99 plus tax. This would likely run you $30 in Manhattan.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171524/IMG_0556-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>Veggie Bronx burrito</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Legends Hospitality<strong><br>Where you can buy:</strong> Section 311<strong><br>YSC+: 120</strong></p><p>There were not many vegetarian or vegan options available during this event but this is a quality option for those who don’t eat meat. The fried sweet plantains are the star of the show here.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171443/IMG_0564-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2><strong>Prickly pear margarita</strong></h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Bar<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 318<strong><br>YSC+: 190</strong></p><p>I know some don’t like tequila and can’t drink it even in mixed drinks. I am not that guy. There’s not a tequila I will pass up. This one is made with Hornito’s, prickly pear juice, simple syrup and lime. I might’ve found my new drink when I’m trying to turn up.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22172144/IMG_0568-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>City Winery burger</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>City Winery<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 105<strong><br>YSC+: 70&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I’m willing to give this one another chance because I do like all of the ingredients and toppings. This burger comes with red wine caramelized onions, garlic herb cheese spread and baby arugula on a toasted brioche bun. The burger I had was dry — the complete opposite of the 99 Burger. But the potential is there for this one to be very good.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171357/IMG_0566-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2><strong>Pork and broccoli rabe cheesesteak&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Legends Hospitality<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 107<strong><br>YSC+: 60&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Full disclosure: I am not a broccoli rabe fan. It’s definitely up there for my least favorite vegetable. Because of that, I likely hated this sandwich because of the broccoli rabe. You probably shouldn’t take my word for this score, though, if broccoli rabe is your thing.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171106/IMG_0574-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><h2>Buffalo chicken mac and cheese</h2><p><strong>Vendor: </strong>Mac Truck<strong><br>Where you can buy: </strong>Section 223<strong><br>YSC+: 155</strong></p><p>I’m putting this one just slightly below the Mexican mac. Both are phenomenal but I just liked how they took Mexican street corn and somehow enhanced an already great food item. The buffalo chicken on this mac wasn’t too spicy as the creaminess of the cheese lowered the heat just the perfect amount. I can see this dish becoming a crowd favorite because it has two things most people enjoy: buffalo chicken and mac and cheese. That’s like bringing together <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Shohei Ohtani</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mike Trout</a> together — except it’s a winning combination.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/03/22171315/IMG_0570-scaled.jpeg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Chris Kirschner / The Athletic)</span><p>If the Lyft to my apartment wasn’t $37 after leaving the stadium, I might’ve taken a car because I felt (still feel) like I am going to combust any moment now.
