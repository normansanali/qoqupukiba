He released CKY on his own. Additionally, CKY2K, CKY3, and CKY4 have been published.</p><p><a href=#>Margera’s </a>videos were discovered by former Big Brother editor Jeff Tremaine after CKY’s breakthrough, who then invited him to join the group that would later become MTV’s Jackass. Other CKY staff members took varying degrees of supporting roles while <a href=#>Margera</a></p>and Ryan Dunn established themselves as cast staples.<p>In the 2003 film Grind, <a href=#>Margera </a>portrayed himself as four young men who follow a professional skateboarder from Chicago to California. Numerous Jackass members, as well as many pro skateboarders and other celebrities, make cameo appearances in the movie.</p><p><a href=#>Margera </a>got married in 2007, and the ceremony was captured on camera for Bam’s Unholy Union, the follow-up to Viva la Bam. During the months leading up to their nuptials, the program follows <a href=#>Margera</a>, his then-fiancée Missy Rothstein, and their friends.</p><p><a href=#>Margera </a>starred in Jackass 3D in October 2010, and the film set new records at the box office. <a href=#>Margera </a>makes an appearance in Bam’s World Domination, a half-hour Spike TV series that premiered on October 13, 2010, alongside Dunn and skateboarder Tim O’Connor.</p><p>Between 1997 and 1998, Toy Machine Skateboards sponsored <a href=#>Margera </a>at the start of his professional skating career. <a href=#>Margera </a>joined the Element Skateboards showcase team, Team Element, in 2001.</p><p><a href=#>Margera </a>left the team in 2016 and is no longer a member. At various points, he was also supported by companies including Volcom, Landspeed Wheels, Destroyer Trucks, Destructo Trucks, Adio Footwear, Electric Sunglasses, Speed Metal Bearings, and Fairman’s Skateshop.</p><p>By 2022, <a href=#>Margera </a>had stopped competing in professional skateboarding and was without any significant sponsors. Three independent movies starring Margera have been written, produced, and released.</p><p>In Haggard (2003), an independent film based on the life of his buddy Ryan Dunn, he co-wrote, directed, and starred. While <a href=#>Margera </a>played “Valo,” a persona based on himself and HIM singer and friend Ville Valo, Dunn played himself as the main role.</p><p>In addition to Minghags, <a href=#>Margera </a>also directed Kiss a Good Man’s Ass. Haggard’s “trash juicer” invention is included in the film, which is a loose sequel to it. The shooting began on April 5, 2007.</p><p>Bam Margera Presents: Where the#$&% Is Santa?, a holiday-themed film, was also released in December 2008 by <a href=#>Margera</a>. In the film, Bam and his friends travel to Finland’s Arctic Circle in search of Santa Claus. Ville Valo from HIM, the Dudesons, Hanoi Rocks, and Mark the Bagger all appear in the movie.</p><p>On November 24, 2004, <a href=#>Margera </a>launched Radio Bam, a weekly Sirius Satellite Radio program on Sirius channel 28 Faction. <a href=#>Margera </a>and his pals from the CKY and Jackass crews were the show’s original cast members.</p><p><a href=#>Margera </a>founded the music company Filthy Note Records in 2005. She has directed music videos for CKY, Clutch, Turbonegro, Viking Skull, and several other bands. Fuckface Unstoppable, <a href=#>Margera’s </a>band, was profiled on the Buddyhead website in 2013, and the writer questioned the band’s seriousness (“a comedy band(?)”).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bam Margera wife: Meet Nicole Boyd</h2><p><a href=#>Margera </a>has been married twice in his life. He was previously married to Missy Rothstein in 2007 and they divorced in 2012.</p><p>He then got married to Nicole Boyd in 2013 and they have been together since. They got married at Reykjavik in Iceland and they have a daughter named Phoenix Wolf Margera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpuYpmWdlr%2BosdGaZLChlpp6rrHErWSnoZOkuaZ5waiwnWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbam-margera-wife-meet-nicole-boyd.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbam-margera-wife-meet-nicole-boyd.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbam-margera-wife-meet-nicole-boyd.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbam-margera-wife-meet-nicole-boyd.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbam-margera-wife-meet-nicole-boyd.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbam-margera-wife-meet-nicole-boyd.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cheryl-strayed-bio-wiki-age-family-husband-children-books-podcast-host-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cheryl-strayed-bio-wiki-age-family-husband-children-books-podcast-host-and-net-worth.html>Cheryl Strayed Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Husband, Children, Books, podcast host, and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./archana-puran-singh.html>Archana Puran Singh Wiki, Age, Husband, Family, Children, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./archana-puran-singh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
