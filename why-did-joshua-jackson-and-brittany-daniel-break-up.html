Joshua Jackson has a lot of famous ex-girlfriends, and one of them is Brittany Daniel, known for Sweet Valley High. Why did Joshua Jackson and Brittany Daniel break up? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=joshua-jackson-and-brittany-daniel-39-s-relationship>Joshua Jackson And Brittany Daniel's Relationship</h2><p>We love hearing about <a href=#>Joshua Jackson's marriage to Jodie Turner-Smith</a> and it's also interesting looking back at the popular actor's romantic history.</p><p>We hear about so many actors who start hanging out about acting together in a film or starring on the same TV show and that's what happened with Joshua Jackson and Brittany Daniel.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couple met because of Dawson's Creek</a>, according to Zimbio.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress played the character of Eve Whitman, who was definitely a fascinating part of the show, if not a very well-liked character. In season 3, Dawson Leery and Eve met each other, and he was interested since she was the new girl in town and he was drawn to her. A major reveal took place when fans learned that Eve and Jen Lindley were half-sisters, making Jen's already sad and complicated family life even worse.</p><p>It's during the season 3 Dawson's Creek Thanksgiving episode that Dawson can tell that Eve and Jen are related. Their mom Helen visits and explains to Jen that she did have another baby. Jen is naturally devastated to learn about this family secret and although she didn't think that she could dislike her parents more, she finds herself more disappointed with her mom and dad then ever before. Eve was only in a few episodes but made a huge splash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People don't seem to know why Joshua Jackson and Brittany Daniel broke up.

It's possible and likely that's why their relationship didn't last.</p><p>Dawson's Creek fans don't love the character of Eve. In a Reddit thread, one fan wrote "I hated her character. I just kept thinking AHHH "Jessica Wakefield" from Sweet Valley High... The storyline of her showing up randomly at the high school but not a student, getting the PSAT answers, etc, it like didn't really make much sense."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan wrote, "I think Eve’s only purpose was to be a “temptress” so that there was an excuse for Dawson to fall away from Joey."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joshua Jackson Slams Haters Who Trolled His Wife For Proposing To Him</a></span></p><h2 id=brittany-daniel-39-s-life-after-39-sweet-valley-high-39>Brittany Daniel's Life After 'Sweet Valley High'</h2><p>Brittany Daniel has been through a lot since she finished starring in Sweet Valley High.
