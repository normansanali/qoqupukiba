Mike Linnington, CEO of Wounded Warrior Project. “This is a day across the country where we honor the sacrifice of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Through the Honor Project, loved ones of fallen service members request a personal visit to their fallen hero. On Armed Forces Day and Memorial Day, hundreds of volunteers from across the country personally visit and place Flags of Valor wooden coins at each hero’s internment location, paying their respects and pausing to reflect on the sacrifices of those service members.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“The Travis Manion Foundation is named for a Marine who was killed in 2007. We are just a community of veterans and family of the fallen who want to serve in honor of the fallen,” said Molly Barnick, Travis Manion Foundation’s chief strategic communications officer. “The Honor Project actually started two years ago in the height of the pandemic in 2020, and it started because there were so many families who couldn’t get access to the cemetery and couldn’t see their loved one or couldn’t travel.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Anne Donne, who retired from the Army National Guard, was one of the volunteers on Monday who checked in, collected commemorative coins for the Honor Project and placed them on gravesites of fallen heroes.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I did serve in the military. I am honestly very honored to be able to take the time. I think that the living, for us, it’s the very least we could do to honor them,” Donne said. “Remember that there are people that gave the ultimate sacrifice for us to be able to do what we do every single day.”</p><h3 class="sc-htpNat dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-5 dZRBCJ"><b>Military working dogs remembered during service</b></h3><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Jacksonville Pet Funeral Home and Pet Memorial Park on Monday held a Memorial Day service to remember military working dogs.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">During the service, a section of the military K-9 memorial section was dedicated to K9s For Warriors, and a K9s For Warriors service dog who died earlier this month was memorialized.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">At the park, there are five memorial pavers dedicated to service dogs, including military service dogs and 9/11 search and rescue dogs.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The service began at 1 p.m. and was open to the public.

The ceremony featured a series of tributes from different military branches.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The free event paid tribute to the brave service members who sacrificed their lives for our freedom and served as a space for people to come together and pay homage to those sacrifices.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Service wreaths were placed in front of the Veterans Memorial Wall, which lists the names of all the Jacksonville service members who gave the greatest sacrifice for our nation.
