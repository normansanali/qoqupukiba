But fans of the legendary singer are more interested in how she continues to look so young as she ages. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Now over 50, Gwen is one of the few women in Hollywood that never seems to age a day</a>. When you compare photos of her from the beginning of her career to now, it’s clear that her porcelain, wrinkle-free skin has hardly changed in 20 years. So what’s her secret?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After much research, we’ve discovered that Gwen’s skincare routine comes down to making smart choices that go beyond cleaning her face properly (although that’s one of her priorities too!). Keep reading to find out exactly what goes into her skincare routine.</p><h2 id=wearing-makeup-products-that-she-feels-good-about><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Wearing Makeup Products That She Feels Good About</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani’s fashion might have drastically evolved over the years</a> but there is one thing that has remained the same: her attitude towards makeup. One of the most important steps in the singer’s skincare routine is only wearing makeup that she feels good about since we all know that wearing poor-quality products can have negative effects on our skin. Stefani still wears grocery store makeup sometimes, as long as it works well and leaves her skin feeling fabulous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=using-sweat-proof-foundation><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Using Sweat-Proof Foundation</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani doesn’t always go makeup-free. When she has to wear heavy stage makeup, she makes sure it’s sweat-proof, revealing in an interview with Cosmopolitan&nbsp;that she’d rather connect with her audience than worry about her makeup. Using a product with fuller coverage means that she always makes the extra effort to clean her face afterward.</p><h2 id=following-a-vegan-diet><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Following A Vegan Diet</span></h2><p class=body-text>The skincare routine followed by Gwen Stefani actually begins with what she puts into her body. She became a vegetarian at the age of 12 and has recently turned to a plant-based diet, with a few exceptions here and there. It’s clear that one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ways Gwen makes 50 look 30</a> is by paying attention to her overall health rather than just relying on expensive skin creams.</p><h2 id=drinking-plenty-of-water><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Drinking Plenty Of Water</span></h2><p>Another way that the ‘Hollaback Girl’ singer keeps her skin looking phenomenal? According to Business Insider, she makes staying hydrated a priority, always being sure to drink enough fluids. Water is nature’s moisturizer, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It can also help you to avoid bloating and having puffy skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trying-to-get-enough-sleep><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Trying To Get Enough Sleep</span></h2><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">skincare tip Gwen uses to look 20 years younger</a> is getting enough sleep. Although the correlation between rest and skin might not be obvious, the superstar admitted to Elle UK&nbsp;that sleep is the best way to beat skin that looks tired. A lack of sleep can result in bags under the eyes and dull skin, so when she can, she’s all about that beauty sleep.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan Markle's Makeup Artist Can Help Brides Prep For Virtual Weddings</a></span></p><h2 id=helping-to-remove-skin-toxins-by-exercising><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Helping To Remove Skin Toxins By Exercising</span></h2><p class=body-text>Many stars, including Gwen Stefani, incorporate regular exercise into their lifestyles in order to look and feel their best. She reportedly works out four times a week for 60-75 minutes. Not only does this help to keep her in shape, but the sweat detoxifies her skin. Exercise also helps the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the skin, through improved blood circulation, which can lead to increased collagen production and the formation of new skin cells.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=starting-her-makeup-again-instead-of-piling-on-layers-of-it><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Starting Her Makeup Again Instead Of Piling On Layers Of It</span></h2><p>Because she often works long hours, Gwen sometimes needs to touch up her makeup before the day is over. But rather than simply reapplying, she likes to “wash it all off and start over again for that fresh-face feeling.” She avoids piling layers of makeup on her skin, allowing it a better chance to breathe.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Hathaway Reveals These Simple Yet Stunning Beauty Secrets</a></span></p><h2 id=staying-out-of-the-sun><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Staying Out Of The Sun</span></h2><p>The top tip that Gwen recommends more than anything else when it comes to looking after your skin is staying out of the sun and wearing adequate protection when you do have to go in the sun. “You definitely see it as you get older,” she confessed to Elle. “… growing up in California, I was pretty good. Not when I was a kid, but once I hit my twenties.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=always-taking-her-makeup-off-at-night><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Always Taking Her Makeup Off At Night</span></h2><p>Gwen Stefani is often in front of a camera or on stage, which means she spends more time than the average person wearing heavy makeup. She counteracts this by always cleaning her face properly at night. “…the key is to keep it clean at night [and] let your face breathe because I really don’t let it breathe at any other time,” she told Elle.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Bizarre But Brilliant Beauty Secrets We've Learned From The Kardashians</a></span></p><h2 id=occasionally-going-makeup-free><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Occasionally Going Makeup-Free</span></h2><p>If the photos she posts to Instagram are anything to go by, it’s clear that Gwen Stefani does go makeup-free upon occasion. And giving your face this break from pore-clogging makeup can work wonders when it comes to rejuvenating your skin. Even if she does wear makeup most of the time, the few times that she does go without makeup all count towards helping her look so young.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From Fish Pedicures To Bird Facials: 15 Celebrity Beauty Treatments</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiesJ2eYsC1scWapaJlo6C2r6%2FAq5xmqp%2Bqwaq6xGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgwen-stefani-skincare-routine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgwen-stefani-skincare-routine.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgwen-stefani-skincare-routine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgwen-stefani-skincare-routine.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgwen-stefani-skincare-routine.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgwen-stefani-skincare-routine.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./trent-thornton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./trent-thornton.html>Trent Thornton | Fan Arch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-scary-reason-the-wicked-witch-actress-couldnt-eat-on-the-wizard-of-oz-set.html>The Scary Reason The Wicked Witch Actress Couldn't Eat On The Wizard Of Oz Set</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-scary-reason-the-wicked-witch-actress-couldnt-eat-on-the-wizard-of-oz-set.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
