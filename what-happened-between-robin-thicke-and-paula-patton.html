That rarely happens, though. You probably have a better chance of being hit by lightning. Plus, the odds of this romantic type of story occurring in Hollywoodland are even slimmer. However, there's always an exception to the rule - for a while, that exception was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paula Patton</a> and Robin Thicke,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who basically put Emily Ratajkowski on the map</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two public figures met early in life and enjoyed a long relationship that ended in marriage. Their story was out of a dream world. However, somewhere down the line, something went haywire. This former couple went from discussing their mutual love in interviews to custody wars and restraining orders. Read below to find out what went wrong between Robin Thicke and Paula Patton.</p><h2 id=they-met-in-an-underage-club><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Met In An Underage Club</span></h2><p>Patton and Thicke met in 1991, at a teen night club - they were 14 and 15, respectively. Patton said in an interview:&nbsp;“He asked me to dance and the rest is history.” Thicke remembers their first meeting, too.</p><p>While dancing, Thicke serenaded Patton by vocalizing Stevie Wonder’s “Jungle Fever” - a smooth move that plainly succeeded&nbsp;and won her over. He admitted: “I knew she was special the night I met her. I was only 14, but she was already the most special girl.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We still can't get over the fact he sung "Jungle Fever" as he was wooing her, though! Laugh out loud.</p><h2 id=the-two-dated-throughout-high-school-amp-college><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The&nbsp;Two Dated Throughout High&nbsp;School&nbsp;&&nbsp;College</span></h2><p>From the time Patton and Thicke met,&nbsp;they felt like they would be together forever. The two dated all through high school, attending functions and dances together. Can you imagine how cute they were! Nothing like the high school sweethearts narrative.</p><p>Wait,&nbsp;the handsome couple dated all through college, as well. Now that's challenging because once high school grads hit the 'big show' (we mean college), they tend to try to find themselves. They begin mingling with different people and grow distant from their&nbsp;familiar partners. Well, not these two! They remained close regardless of college pressures and lifestyles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Not-So-Flattering Facts About Robin Thicke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-couple-married-in-2005><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Couple Married In 2005</span></h2><p>After ten years of dating, Thicke and Patton chose to take their relationship to the next level. In June 2005, the couple got married. Patton said, a year previously: "We've known each other since we were teenagers. All I can tell you is there's a deep love there -- always was, and always will be."</p><p>How awesome is that — to grow up together, dutifully love each other for a decade and then become husband and wife? It's beyond awesome...it's a fairytale! From photos that we've seen from the wedding, the two were beaming. That day was filled with elation and love.</p><h2 id=their-first-child-was-born-5-years-later><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Their First Child Was Born 5 Years Later</span></h2><p>♪ Paula and Robin sitting in a tree, K-I-SS-I-N-G. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Paula with the baby carriage.&nbsp;♪ Wow, how accurate&nbsp;are those lyrics! After being in love for ten years, and being married for five years, in April 2010, the couple welcomed Julian, their son, to the world.</p><p>“He makes me feel beautiful," said Patton of Thicke. "That’s the best thing about having a partner — there is someone to tell you, ‘Stop it. You look great!’ Of course, he can’t say anything else — he’s been trained.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Have you shed a tear yet? Hand us a Kleenex please, now!</p><h2 id=thicke-s-breakout-hit-record-is-about-patton><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Thicke's Breakout Hit Record Is About Patton</span></h2><p>Thicke’s 2013 smash hit, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blurred Lines</a>,” launched&nbsp;his fame out into the stratosphere. Abruptly, Patton and Thicke were on everybody’s radar —&nbsp;though, not for the best reasons. Thicke expressed: “I don’t think people got it. I wrote it about my wife … she’s my good girl. And I know she wants it because we’ve been together for 20 years.”</p><p>As his hit&nbsp;record&nbsp;surged on the charts, Thicke was&nbsp;combating&nbsp;alcohol and drug issues behind closed doors.&nbsp;“Every day I woke up, I would take a Vicodin to start the day and then I would fill up a water bottle with vodka and drink it before and during my interviews,”&nbsp;said Thicke. He even admitted he “didn’t do a sober interview” while promoting&nbsp;the&nbsp;song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=uh-oh-here-comes-the-cheating-rumors><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Uh Oh! Here Comes The Cheating Rumors</span></h2><p>As Patton publicly defended her husband's racy on-stage&nbsp;rendition of "Blurred Lines" with Miley Cyrus, cheating rumors surrounding Thicke started emerging. In fall 2013, a picture&nbsp;was published of his hand on another woman's buttocks&nbsp;at a party. Thicke provided a nebulous explanation for his&nbsp;actions.</p><p>“My only comment about the so-called scandalous photo would be that my wife and I are perfectly in love and very happily married. So, no complaints there,” noted Thicke. He referred to their kinship also as “the greatest love of the century and the most functional dysfunctional marriage in Hollywood.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3 Celeb Co-Parents Who Can't Agree On Anything (13 Who Make A Great Team)</a></span></p><h2 id=thicke-called-on-oprah-for-relationship-help><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Thicke Called On Oprah For Relationship Help</span></h2><p>Following&nbsp;Thicke’s iffy behavior (and divisive explanation), he sat down with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah Winfrey</a>&nbsp;in 2013, to sort matters out. He explained what he was thinking when he made his “functional dysfunctional” remark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That was just saying we’re no different than any couple out there, that we have our problems and our fights, but somehow there is this big bang theory that just pulls us close to each other — and we are madly in love, and can’t quit each other,” explained Thicke.</p><p>The singer furthered: “I still have the girl. I would be lost without&nbsp;Paula … [Fame] is a lot and there are&nbsp;females throwing themselves at you and you can really lose touch with any sense of reality when you’re a big rock star kind of thing.”</p><h2 id=the-long-time-couple-call-it-quits><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Long-Time Couple Call It Quits</span></h2><p>Thicke and Patton shared the news in February 2014 that they&nbsp;were calling it quits. In a joint statement, the two said: “We will always love each other and be best friends; however, we have mutually decided to separate at this time.”</p><p>The&nbsp;couple kept&nbsp;things civil for some time, making certain to prioritize their&nbsp;child and stay a family. Thicke even&nbsp;attempted to win Patton back by devoting a performance of “Lost Without U” at a concert to her. “She loved it. She thought it was the sweetest thing and very romantic, and I’ve always been a romantic guy that way,” said Thicke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He even&nbsp;created&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole studio album about their split, naming it Paula, though it wasn’t quite well-received.&nbsp;Thicke&nbsp;disclosed to Hot 97: “The album is exactly what happens when you lose the love of your life and you’re trying to figure it out in your head.”</p><h2 id=thicke-publicly-admits-he-tarnished-the-relationship><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Thicke Publicly Admits He Tarnished The Relationship</span></h2><p>In another effort to get back in good with Patton, Thicke publicly acknowledged that he was the reason they’d broken up. “We’re apart because we just couldn’t be together anymore for a while,” noted Thicke.</p><p>“There’s a hundred different reasons, there isn’t just one. There’s a long list … I changed, and I got a little too selfish, a little too greedy, and little too full of myself.” Basically, he wound up letting his stardom get to his head, which is precisely what he told Winfrey he wouldn’t do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-engaged-in-an-ugly-custody-battle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Two Engaged In An Ugly Custody Battle</span></h2><p>In January 2017,&nbsp;Patton filed an emergency order to&nbsp;stop Thicke from visiting&nbsp;Julian. The L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services was probing allegations that the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost Without U</a>" singer&nbsp;had been physically abusive toward their son.</p><p>Thick explained via court documents: “On a very rare occasion and only as a last resort, I will use light spanking, but it is consistent with the law — open hand on the butt. This is the type of discipline to which Paula and I agreed during our marriage.” Additionally, Patton claimed&nbsp;he “physically abused and cheated on her during their marriage.”</p><p>Patton&nbsp;was given sole custody of their son temporarily, while a temporary restraining order was also issued against Thicke. Patton and Thicke&nbsp;laid&nbsp;their custody battle to rest seven months later. In August 2017,&nbsp;the couple agreed to a deal with cyclic physical custody.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Masked Singer: Here's What We Know About The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thicke-got-himself-a-new-squeeze><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Thicke Got Himself A New Squeeze</span></h2><p>Thicke was the first in the relationship to move on. In February 2018, he welcomed a new child with&nbsp;April Love Geary, and the baby girl was named&nbsp;Mia Love Thicke. Geary made the announcement via Instagram, posting that their child’s due date and&nbsp;Thicke’s father’s birthday were the same.</p><p>In December 2016, the singer's father, actor Alan Thicke,&nbsp;died&nbsp;of type-A aortic dissection.&nbsp;Geary indicated: “Robin and I are very excited to share with you all that we’re having a baby! The due date is March 1st, Alan’s birthday!”</p><h2 id=patton-embraces-thicke-s-fianc><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Patton Embraces Thicke's Fiancé</span></h2><p>In August 2019,&nbsp;Thicke met with Patton in Malibu,&nbsp;and the paps snapped photos of Paula embracing April Love Geary. The "2 Guns" actress was all smiles as she hugged the 25-year-old bikini model. Was Patton merely being cordial, or has she moved on herself?</p><p>In January 2020, Patton&nbsp;was spotted in Manhattan,&nbsp;grinning and holding hands with Zach Quittman, her new beau.&nbsp;“I have a boyfriend now. I haven’t called anybody a boyfriend. He’s my boyfriend!” said Patton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair began dating back in December 2019, however, Patton looks as if she is head over heels in love with the hunky realtor. She&nbsp;emphasized:&nbsp;“But when you know, you know. I love him.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened Between Chris Martin And Gwyneth Paltrow?</a></span></p><p>Sources: E!, Vanity Fair, Women's Health, NY Daily News, People, Meaww, Star, CNN, Fox News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmqp%2BXtq9506GgnKOVYq6vsIypmK6kkWK9osDTqKVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-robin-thicke-and-paula-patton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-robin-thicke-and-paula-patton.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-robin-thicke-and-paula-patton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-robin-thicke-and-paula-patton.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-robin-thicke-and-paula-patton.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-robin-thicke-and-paula-patton.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-lane-frost.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-lane-frost.html>What Happened To Lane Frost?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./baz-luhrmann-explains-faraway-downs-australia-series-differences-html.html>Time Has Caught Up With Us</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./baz-luhrmann-explains-faraway-downs-australia-series-differences-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
