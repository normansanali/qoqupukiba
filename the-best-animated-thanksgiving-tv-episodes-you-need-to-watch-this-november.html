It’s the preeminent time for joy, cheer, and garbage television, which actually makes for some entertaining fun. So before you jingle those bells and deck the halls, it’s important to grab a seat on the couch and adhere to an assortment of gnarly <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thanksgiving</a></strong> TV specials.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>And while a large majority of the very best Thanksgiving TV episodes pertain to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">classic ‘90s family sitcoms</a>, there’s certainly no denying that a plethora of infamous animated series have produced a fair share of memorable episodes related to Turkey Day. Of course, it seems absolutely pointless to indulge in a variety of flavorful pies and a full plate of stuffing without having the television blaring in the background.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>So from classic animated shows from the ‘90s to modern-day comedies which continue to provide us with endless laughs, let’s dive in and explore the best animated Thanksgiving TV episodes that are perfect for watchlists this November.</p><h2 id=h-garfield-garfield-s-thanksgiving data-injectable=false>Garfield – “Garfield’s Thanksgiving”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/garfield-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Considering the entire series is about a pudgy cat who loves to eat like his life depends on it, need I actually say more? Nevertheless, Garfield is one of those nostalgic TV shows that just never seems to leave your mind — especially the episode where Garfield is placed on a strict diet right before Thanksgiving. Naturally, Garfield retaliates by trying to sabotage his owner Jon’s dinner date, all because he couldn’t indulge in a huge feast. It’s so, so silly, but also undoubtedly hilarious.</p><h2 id=h-american-dad-there-will-be-bad-blood data-injectable=false>American Dad! – “There Will Be Bad Blood”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/american-dad-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>There’s a strong reason why ever-popular animated series such as American Dad! and Family Guy attracts such a wide audience — because these shows are incredibly funny. And just like with every other major show out there, audiences are further captivated by particular holiday specials, which certainly helps when you realize just how masterful this Thanksgiving episode is. Hitting the nail on the head in terms of social issues and greed, this episode is the perfect watch for Turkey Day.</p><h2 id=h-rugrats-the-turkey-who-came-to-dinner data-injectable=false>Rugrats – “The Turkey Who Came to Dinner”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rugrats-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>You’d be hard-pressed to find a singular soul who grew up as a ‘90s kid who wasn’t completely obsessed with Rugrats. Just as often as the beloved series focused on the lives of a group of babies, the series also managed to touch on more serious topics — especially in this specific Thanksgiving episode, where the infants are taught about the true story of Native Americans and the expedition of the pilgrims. It’s a must-watch episode that all should adhere to this November.</p><h2 id=h-winnie-the-pooh-a-winnie-the-pooh-thanksgiving data-injectable=false>Winnie the Pooh – “A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/winnie-the-pooh-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>For some of us, Winnie the Pooh isn’t just a character, but a way of life. For some of us, our first birthday party featured us dressed head-to-toe in Winnie the Pooh attire. Oh, just me? That’s alright. Anyway, this made-for-TV special undoubtedly showcases a whirlwind of nostalgia — with the entire group gathering together to share a marvelous Thanksgiving feast amongst them. And even when the dinner is seemingly ruined, the gang all learn that spending quality time with friends and family is the true importance.</p><h2 id=h-bob-s-burgers-turkey-in-a-can data-injectable=false>Bob’s Burgers – “Turkey in a Can”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bobs-burgers-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=816 data-injectable=true>Out of all the fantastic television shows on this list, I’d humbly argue that very few can handle Thanksgiving episodes as good as Bob’s Burgers. But while the show possesses a handful of memorable Turkey Day specials, there’s simply no denying that “Turkey in a Can” is the cream of the crop. With the witty special centering around a turkey-destroying perpetrator who keeps placing the uncooked bird in various toilets, there’s plenty of gut-busting humor to make your Thanksgiving even more memorable.</p><h2 id=h-south-park-black-friday data-injectable=false>South Park – “Black Friday”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/south-park-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>Technically, this isn’t a Thanksgiving episode per se, so we are bending the rules a little bit, but this episode of South Park is worth it. So while this doesn’t specifically pertain to Thanksgiving, it takes place the day after — which has gotta count for something. As its title happily suggests, the special centers around the chaos and insanity that occurs during most Black Friday sales. The special partially pokes fun at Game of Thrones, which certainly makes for excellent TV.</p><h2 id=h-king-of-the-hill-happy-hank-s-giving data-injectable=false>King of the Hill – “Happy Hank’s Giving”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/king-of-the-hill-thanksgiving.jpg><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>If you’re like me and grew up around the potty mouths of your dad and uncles, then King of the Hill feels like nothing short of a blast from the past of childhood. But in the show’s specific Thanksgiving episode, the familiar Hill family find themselves caught up in the escapable holiday rush and wind up stranded at the airport rather than loosening their pants and eating an entire feast of stuffing and pie. It’s not an ideal real-life situation, but it makes for a comical episode.</p><h2 id=h-hey-arnold-arnold-s-thanksgiving data-injectable=false>Hey Arnold! – “Arnold’s Thanksgiving”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hey-arnold-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>I might be a little biased here, but Hey Arnold! Is definitely one of the best animated series from the ‘90s. Centering around the titular football-headed Arnold, this Turkey Day extravaganza revolves around Arnold and his friend-slash-nemesis Helga ditching their own families and attending Thanksgiving dinner at their teacher’s house. In the end, the pair realize that spending quality time with their own kin is truly what the holiday is all about.</p><h2 id=h-peanuts-a-charlie-brown-thanksgiving data-injectable=false>Peanuts – A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/a-charlie-brown-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>I already know that lovable jingle is in your head right now, because who doesn’t hum the Peanuts theme song to themselves from time to time? Aside from the infectious theme song, this Thanksgiving special makes the rest of these episodes seem meaningless — especially when the episode perfectly tackles the theme of family and the importance of being with loved ones for the Thanksgiving festivities. You’ll definitely want to add this one to the watchlist for this year’s Turkey Day.</p><h2 id=h-the-simpsons-bart-vs-thanksgiving data-injectable=false>The Simpsons – “Bart vs. Thanksgiving”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bart-vs-thanksgiving.png><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=false>There’s several huge reasons as to why The Simpsons is one of the most popular animated series of all time, and its unforgettable Thanksgiving episode is definitely a fantastic example. In the favorable episode, chaos absolutely ensues once Bart breaks his sister Lisa’s centerpiece. Disgruntled and upset, Bart soon runs away from home and eventually finds himself in a soup kitchen. In the end, Bart realizes the error of his ways and returns home to be with the one thing that cannot be replaced — family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGKur7XMmquenF2ptaK6yqyeoq6Zo7RuwNVmnKmho6Sxpr%2BMsqauZZ6asqV506hksJmkmLVuwMeiqmamn6uyrq7Eq2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-animated-thanksgiving-tv-episodes-you-need-to-watch-this-november.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-best-animated-thanksgiving-tv-episodes-you-need-to-watch-this-november.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-animated-thanksgiving-tv-episodes-you-need-to-watch-this-november.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-best-animated-thanksgiving-tv-episodes-you-need-to-watch-this-november.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-animated-thanksgiving-tv-episodes-you-need-to-watch-this-november.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-animated-thanksgiving-tv-episodes-you-need-to-watch-this-november.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./thor-love-and-thunder-theory-thinks-korg-may-be-an-unreliable-narrator.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./thor-love-and-thunder-theory-thinks-korg-may-be-an-unreliable-narrator.html>Thor: Love and Thunder theory thinks Korg may be an unreliable narrator</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./scottie-pippen-biography-net-worth-wife-age-height-children-stats-parents.html>Scottie Pippen Biography: Net Worth, Wife, Age, Height, Children, Stats, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./scottie-pippen-biography-net-worth-wife-age-height-children-stats-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
