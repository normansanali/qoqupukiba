During their time together, they also had one daughter, Katie Springer. Despite being together for over two decades, their relationship has recently come back into the limelight after it was announced that Jerry passed away on April 27, 2023.</p><p>He passed away at his home in Chicago, Sky News reports.

This could also be because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer failed to connect with people</a>, at least romantically, as he was very popular.</p><p>"People know me straight away as the TV guy, so we are not starting off on a level footing. They already know a bunch of stuff about me, whereas I don't know them at all," he said, according to The Mirror.</p><p>"When you get to the mutual interests, it's all about, 'What's the show like? Is it real?' and invariably, they are going to go home afterward and tell all their friends, 'I met Jerry Springer.' So you will never find someone who will just say, 'Hey, I just met this really nice guy, you should meet him.'"</p><h2 id=inside-jerry-springer-39-s-relationship-with-wife-micki-velton>Inside Jerry Springer's Relationship With Wife Micki Velton</h2><p>Jerry Springer and Micki Velton met after being set up on a blind date in 1969, The Sun reports.

This is because, in 1973, Springer made headlines for visiting a brothel, The Mirror reports. The publication claims that he confessed to paying workers twice but that Velton forgave him for his indiscretions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jerry Springer Was Clearly Uncomfortable With David Letterman's Question And Purposely Decided To Change The Subject During Their Interview</a></span></p><p>They would remain together, so it is highly unlikely that these actions had any lasting impact on Springer's marriage.

However, his ex-wife was not one for fame. Instead, she preferred to stay out of the limelight, even when they were married.</p><p>The same can be said for her life following the divorce, and it is near impossible to find out what Micki Velton has been up to because she has removed herself from the public eye. She also does not appear to have social media (at least not publicly or in her name), which makes her even more mysterious. And don't expect to see any photos of her taken by the paparazzi anytime, either!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jerry-springer-was-clearly-uncomfortable-with-david-letterman-s-question-and-purposely-decided-to-change-the-subject-during-their-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But they appear to have remained in touch because Closer Weekly reports that the former couple were photographed together outside The Ritz hotel in New York City. This was in 2011 (many years after they got divorced).</p><p>The mystery extends to Jerry Springer, who was also incredibly private about his personal life. But we know he was a grandfather, a role he appeared to enjoy. His only child, Katie, married Adam Yenkin, and they had a child, Richard. Springer spoke about his grandson in an interview with New York Post (via Yahoo) when his grandson was three.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Jerry Springer Before He Became The King Of Daytime Television?</a></span></p><p>"He'll be three years old next month, and he still doesn't have a job," Springer joked.
