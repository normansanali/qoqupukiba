Apparently, his mom "like her and love her too. Hard to accomplish that too, those two things."</p><p id=egBrmZWSrMq data-wc=52>He told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that they have an "amazing dynamic" where he is "able to be passionate still about what I do and have an incredible partner to work through some of the harder times as a young man dealing with children and dealing with the dynamic of how you communicate with them."</p><p id=eCNwoIMw0_x data-wc=55>When discussing their family life, the King of R&B explained that Jenn is a great communicator with their kids where he isn't. He explained: "She's better at it than me in many lights. I'm a man-man, so I'm like, 'This is what we're doing,' and I might be a little bit more disciplinary at times."</p><p id=exK941HAvfD data-wc=30>But generally, it's clear Usher feels incredibly lucky.
